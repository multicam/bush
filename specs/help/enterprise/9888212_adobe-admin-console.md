Adobe Admin Console is a central location for managing Adobe entitlements across your organization. Eligible Frame.io accounts will be able to manage their Frame.io users using a single Adobe identity, enable easier integration across other Adobe tools and products, and much more. 

Visit [this HelpX page](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html) to learn more about the Adobe Admin Console, including what it can do, how to set it up, and how to navigate though it for the first time. **Eligibility** Eligibility to manage Frame.io within the Adobe Admin Console is currently limited to Frame.io Enterprise accounts created on or after October 2024 and Frame.io Team plans available via our telesales team. Eligibility will be expanded over the coming months across more plan types. 

 

Organizations that use Adobe’s [Global Admin Console](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/global-admin-console/adopt-global-administration.html) are not eligible to allocate Frame.io licenses to Admin Consoles at this time. **Existing Frame.io V4 Enterprise Customers:** If you are an existing Frame.io V4 customer interested in Admin Console, contact your account team to learn more about eligibility criteria and timelines for transitioning your account to manage Users and Roles via Admin Console. 

**Existing Frame.io Legacy (V3) Enterprise Customers:** If you are an existing Frame.io Legacy customer interested in Admin Console, contact your account team to learn more about first migrating your Frame.io account to V4. 
​ **Managing Frame.io Users via Adobe Admin Console** Depending on your requirements, you may add, remove, or update users individually, or use one of the available bulk upload or automated sync methods.

**Managing User Roles via Adobe Admin Console ** When adding Users via Admin Console, you’ll be prompted to set a Frame.io Role type: **Content Admin** or **Member**. This is a Frame.io account-level Role. Granular Frame.io Workspace and Project permissions are set via Frame.io. **Content Admin Role: ** A Content Admin is a user who will have access to all public Workspaces and Projects. They can manage member permissions and access as needed. 

**Member Role: ** A Member is an account user who will have access to whichever Workspace or Projects are assigned to them. Members will also be given a permission level that allows them however much access they are needed to any given Project or Workspace.
