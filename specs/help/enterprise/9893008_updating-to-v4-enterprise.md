# How to update to V4For Enterprise customers looking to update to the latest version of Frame.io, please work with your Account Manager to discuss your best update path and update planning. 

 

There will be a portion of existing Enterprise customers who are eligible to update to V4 and will have the ability to self-serve update their account to V4 at a time of their choosing. Others may need to delay until specific features are available. 

 

If you want to know more about the process of updating your account from Legacy to V4, review the information in this article **[here](https://support.frame.io/en/articles/9892445-how-to-get-frame-io-version-4)**. 

# What to expect when updating to the latest version of Frame.ioHere are some key things to look out for when updating your account from Legacy to V4.

 

## User Roles from Legacy to V4User roles and permissions are one of the bigger shifts from Legacy to V4 that you will want to be aware of. Your users in Legacy will change to brand-new user roles when you update.

 

When you update your account from Legacy to V4, all users will be defaulted to new roles. The chart below will show you how your users will map over.

## Workspaces and Projects 

A new term to learn in Frame.io V4 is **Workspaces**, or what was once known as Teams in Legacy. 

All the Teams and Projects that you had access to in Legacy will be accessible via the new Workspace homepage. Private Projects will retain their privacy and, upon updating, all Members must be invited back to them to gain access.

 

## Share links**Share links** is the new terminology in V4 for Review and Presentation links from Legacy. 

All Legacy Review and Presentation links will be migrated to V4, and any comments made on assets in those links will be reflected in the assets in V4. Users will be able to access Review and Presentation links, as well as delete or disable the links, by going to the All Shares dropdown.

 

 

Click into **All Share Links **in the bottom-left Share tab and at the top-center of your Project page, there will be a dropdown listed as **All Shares** which will contain all the migrated Legacy Review and Presentation links. 

 

*Note:** These Legacy Shares will not be configurable within V4. However, you can go to the link&#x27;s three-dot menu and select** Duplicate as V4 Share** to modify the new Shares. This will create a new V4 share (with a new URL) using all the assets that were in the Review or Presentation link.* 

## Commenting 

For Team and Enterprise plans with Legacy Team Only Comments, those comments (now known as **Internal Comments**) will be hidden by default when updating to V4. 

If an Owner or Admin would like to restore these comments, they can contact Support who will be able to restore Legacy Team Only Comments to become V4 Internal Comments, allowing all members of the Project/Workspace to view/access.
