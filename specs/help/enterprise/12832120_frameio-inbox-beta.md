**What is Inbox?** **Inbox (Beta)** is a central place in Frame.io where you can track and organize all share links sent directly to you. 

When **Secure Sharing** is enabled on an Enterprise account, adding people by name or email ensures they can easily find and review shared media in their Inbox. 

**How to Send a Share Link** Select the media you want to share and click **Share**. In the **Name or Email** field, add the people you want to share with. Adjust your share settings, then click **Send**. 
 

Recipients will get an email notification inviting them to view and review the shared media. Clicking **Review Now** opens the share link directly in Frame.io. 

 

**How to View Your Inbox** Open your Frame.io account on the web.

Click the **Inbox** icon in the primary navigation bar. 
Your Inbox lists all share links sent to you. 

Click a listing to open the share in a new tab. 

Use **filters** to view links marked as **Opened** or **Unopened**. Use the **search bar** to quickly find specific shares. 
**Inbox on iOS** Inbox is also available in the **Frame.io iOS app so you can always review on the go. ** Tap the **Inbox** icon to open it. Access the same share links, filters, and search options as on the web. 

 

**FAQs** **Q: Who can use the Inbox (beta)?****A:** Paid Members of **Enterprise** accounts and **Reviewers** who sign up for a free Frame.io account. Reviewers have access to a simplified interface to manage their received shares, including notifications and filters. 

**Q: Can I remove a share from my Inbox?** **A: **Not yet. Inbox currently displays all active share links sent to you. Leverage the filters to keep your inbox at zero! Also, if a share link expires or is deleted by the sender, it will automatically disappear from your Inbox. 

**Q: Do I need a Frame.io account to use Inbox?** **A: **Yes. Reviewers will be prompted to create a free Frame.io account to access their Inbox and review shared media.
