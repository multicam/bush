Attaching files allow you to send additional media to support your projects as part of your comments in the Details panel. Any file type can be uploaded as an attachment, with videos, images, audio, and PDF files supported with full playback within the comment as a “QuickLook” preview.

*Note:** File attachments are only for Pro plans or higher.* 

When you make a new comment, select the paper clip icon to attach a file to that comment. It can also be added by dragging and dropping the file on top of the comment. 
​
The same action can be made for replies to an existing comment as well. Click the edit button on a comment you want to attach a file to after the comment was already published.
​
There can only be 6 attached files per comment. Replies within a comment thread have a 6 attachment limit as well.
