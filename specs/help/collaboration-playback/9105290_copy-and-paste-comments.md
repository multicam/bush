You can copy and paste comments from one asset to another from within the media player.
​
Open up your options in the Detail panel and select Copy Comment. 

 

Then open a new asset and from the same options you should now see Paste Comment selectable.
​
Once pasted, all the comments you originally selected will appear in this asset, including annotations and attachments.
​
Only visible comments, including filtered or searched, will be copied. Use the filter options to ensure the comments you want will copy over.
​
You can also copy and paste comments between any asset type, meaning it doesn’t have to be between video to video file, audio to audio, etc. If, for example, a video file is copied and pasted into an image file, the same metadata and timeline information will still appear, even though there is no timeline on an image.
