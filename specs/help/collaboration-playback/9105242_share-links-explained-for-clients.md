**Viewing media on a Share Link**Click into any folder or click on a media file to open it. Highlighting a media file will show a comments preview and property details. If the option to download is turned on, there will be a download button in the bottom-right corner once a folder or media asset is highlighted in Grid format. The download button appears next to each asset name on hover or in the top right corner of the page in Reel format. Autoplay may be turned on automatically on a Reel, but can be turned off upon viewing the media.

*Note:** If the link has been protected with a passphrase, you&#x27;ll be prompted to enter this before you can view the files.***Playback and Commenting**Existing comments will be expanded if commenting is enabled in the Share Link, and can be collapsed for a cleaner viewing experience.
​
When typing a comment, the video will pause so you can write your feedback timestamp your comment.
​
To submit your comment, click **Send** or press the **Enter** key. If this is your first comment and you&#x27;re not actively signed into Frame.io, you will be prompted to enter your name and email address. This is so other users know who has commented, as well as for you to receive notifications for future feedback updates.
​
Comments can also be sent without being timestamped by clicking the checkmark on the left.
​
Going deeper with commenting, if you want to further communicate your idea after typing in your comment, select the paintbrush tool to **draw** directly on the video with different shapes and colors. The drawings do not affect the original uploaded file.​*Note: **If you are not logged into your Frame.io account and you leave your review session, you will not be able to edit your previous session&#x27;s comments. ***Range-Based and Anchored Comments**As soon as you start typing your comment, a yellow selector will appear on your player bar. Drag the handle to select a range and click Send or press Enter. Once the comment has been submitted, the range will be indicated with a line on your timeline.
​
​**Shortcut Pro Tip**: Hold down shift and use your left/right arrows for precision scrubbing. 
​
Press the **ESC** key to remove the range if you&#x27;d rather leave a timestamp comment.
​
Selecting a comment will highlight the range. Press the spacebar to play the range or turn on looping to play it in a loop.
​
Press the **ESC** key to clear the playback range/loop.
​**Comment Panel**Clicking on a comment card in the Comment Bar will take you to the exact frame where a comment was left. You can also hover over any of the colored dots along your timeline to display the comment.
​
Mark a comment complete by clicking on the circle in the comment card. Choose to hide/display completed comments by toggling the **Hide** button.
​# Featured FieldIf enabled, the **Featured field** will showcase a field chosen by the Share Link sender to give you the option to contribute to the chosen field. For example, if ratings are available, you can list your rating of the asset, or if status is available, you can make a status of the asset, etc. The updates made to the field here will be shown on assets in the Project.
​**FAQ****Q: As a reviewer, what are my download options (if made available)?**
​**A:** Clicking **Download** will allow the option for both the original and proxy downloads. If there is no download option, reach out to the Share Link sender to enable this feature.
