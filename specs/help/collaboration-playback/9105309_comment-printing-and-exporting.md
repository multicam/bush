## Comment PrintingClicking **Print Comments **will generate a comments page ready to print, including a rich document-style export of the comments with a thumbnail image of the frame/page where each comment was left, as well as comment attachments, emoji reactions, annotations, and anchored comment placements. 

The Print Comments option is right next to the **Export Comments **option inside your player page. From there, you can choose to print the page or save the page as a PDF. When the sorting options being used (i.e., ordered by timecode), the page will be displayed by that sort. 

## Comment ExportingExport comments outside of Frame.io for use in other integrations such as FCP 10.4.0+, Media Composer, Premiere Pro, and Resolve. You have them available in standard CSV or Plain Text files as well. The option can be found in the three-dot menu in the Comments tab of your Details page.
​
Exporting comments will include however the filter options are applied. Anything visible after applying filters will be exported. Make sure to check filters or temporarily disable them to ensure all comments are exported, if that’s your intention. Any changes made to your filtered view or through comment search will reflect differently in future comment exports.
