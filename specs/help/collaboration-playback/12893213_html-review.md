HTML support will offer Frame.io the ability to upload interactive HTML files for review directly from your .zip files. Review your HTML animations, ads with streaming video or audio, and interactive banners with Frame.io’s review and approval tools. 

 

If an HTML file is detected in a .zip file upload, a prompt will appear asking to convert the HTML into interactive web assets. If kept as a .zip, it will not have review and approval access, though you can convert it as interactive after the upload though options. This file can still be organized, shared, and downloaded on Frame.io. Allow some time for all of the files to be recognized as an interactive file as they upload. 

 

Click the tick at the bottom to bypass this prompt and allow for all .zip folders to deliver interactive files. It can be later managed from the Workspace settings as well. 

*Note:** To interact with your HTML file, you must upload it packaged inside of a .zip file. Uploading an HTML file on its own will be delivered as a static image/PDF. The .zip file must also contain at least one HTML file at the root folder level to be offered the option to convert it as interactive.* 

 

Click on **Yes** and the file will change from pink to green with a new **Interactive **tag in the thumbnail. Once the thumbnail changes to the HTML image, your file is finished processing and can be opened. 

## Viewing Interactive HTML 

The left column will show all available HTML files to interact with. Click on any page to load the HTML page or image. 

 

The viewer will show your interactive HTML, allowing you to scroll through, view animations, and click URL links. Clicking on an external URL link will prompt a message and open a new tab in your browser. Use the zoom options to adjust your view of the HTML. Resolution can also be adjusted to resize and change the view of your interactive HTML. 

 

Reviews can be made as regular static comments on the HTML page, or as anchor comments to leave notes directly on the page. The anchor comment icon can be found next to the Settings cog at the bottom of the viewer. Comments will show which HTML page is being referenced in the comment card as well as resolution info.
