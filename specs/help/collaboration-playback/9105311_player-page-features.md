## Playback**Playback Speeds**While viewing your clip, click the &quot;1x&quot; icon on the video player to open different playback rates. By default, the playback will start at 1x or Normal, but adjusting the slider to the right will speed up the playback rate by 0.05x iterations, all the way up to 1.75x. Adjusting the slider to the left will slow down the playback rate by 0.05x iterations, all the way down to 0.25x.
​
You may also adjust playback speeds by using keyboard shortcuts.
​
​**JKL** shortcuts follow standard NLE behavior:
​**(J)** to rewind 2x,4x,8x
​**(K)** pause/play a video
​**(L)** fast forward 2x,4x,8x
A visual signifier of your current speed will be displayed on your video each time you use a shortcut.
​
Quickly toggle to fullscreen mode with the **(F)** key. JKL is also available while in fullscreen mode; however, you won’t see the visual signifiers if you switch your playback speed.
​## Playback ResolutionTo adjust the playback resolution, click the **Gear icon** in the bottom right corner and select “**Quality**”. The available resolutions is dependent on the original files resolution and your plan. 

 

Pro plans and higher will support 4K playback.
​**Loop Playback**Working on short clips? Select “Loop” to play continuously.
​### Player Frame GuidesIf your content will be viewed across various formats, you can use the frame guides to see what your asset would look like in different aspect ratios. Click the &quot;Gear&quot; icon and select &quot;**Guides**&quot;. Toggling &quot;**Mask**&quot; on will hide anything outside of the guide.
​
The guides only impact the playback of your file and won’t alter the downloaded or uploaded file in Frame.io.

​**FAQ****Q: How come when I open a new video, the playback rate doesn&#x27;t default to 1x?**
​**A:** Whatever playback rate you exit the video with it set as, it will reflect onto the next video you open up as the new default. This is to keep consistency with viewing multiple videos. Reset the speed manually to 1x if you wish to keep the playback speed normal.
