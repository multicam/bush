Still images require great attention to detail. Collaboration doesn&#x27;t end with video; we have different tools for viewing images on the player page too.

Upload high-resolution raw images (up to 8K or 42MP in 100 different RAW formats, including Fujifilm, Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, and Sony in-app, powered by Adobe Camera RAW).

Native CMYK color support

Zoom, Pan, and Loupe to inspect assets at 100% resolution. Annotations that you make on your images will scale as well (keyboard shortcuts listed below).

Compare image versions side-by-side and use the new stills comparison tool to zoom, pan, and scan between two photos in unison, and overlay the images on top of one another with transparency.

**Keyboard Shortcuts****F**: full screen, and exit fullscreen
​**Esc**: exit fullscreen
​**Shift**: Image Loupe (100% view)
​**Shift + Click**: zooms to 100%
​**-/+**: zoom in/out by double/half
​**Z + Click + Drag**: Marquee Zoom
​
The Image Viewer is supported in the web app and iOS app.
