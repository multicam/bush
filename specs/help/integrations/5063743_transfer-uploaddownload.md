**Download**To download, select one or more projects, folders, or files within a folder, click the **Download** button, and select a quality level. The selected assets will immediately begin downloading to your device. 

View the status of all active downloads by clicking the **Transfers** button in the app window&#x27;s bottom left corner. Transfer progress will also display on the bottom of the app as the action begins to process. If you have desktop notifications turned on (adjustable via the app preferences), you will be notified when the download completes or when an issue is encountered.
Additional options include canceling a single download, all downloads, or clearing completed items from your transfer history. Right-click on an in-progress of complete transfer to open the options menu where you can: reveal an asset’s location within Frame.io, reveal an asset’s location on your device, or view the log file. 

**Upload**To upload, select a project or folder location within the Transfer app’s file navigator, click the** Upload **button, select the assets you wish to upload to this project or folder, and then click **Select**. Alternatively, drag and drop assets from your desktop into the Transfer app; uploading will begin. 
​
The status of uploading files can be viewed by clicking the Transfers button. Each upload batch can be tracked, reordered, or canceled. For batch uploads, assets and folders can be displayed to track individual progress in the file navigator. Once the upload is complete, the date and time of upload will display for each individual asset in the Date Uploaded column.

**FAQ****Q: If I have the Transfer app already installed, do the same steps apply in the web app?**
​**A: **If you already have Frame.io Transfer installed on your device, you can still initiate downloads to Frame.io Transfer from the web app. Just follow the prompts described above.
​
​**Q: Who can use Frame.io Transfer?**
​**A:** All users can use Transfer to download assets, but only Team Members and Collaborators can use Transfer to upload assets. For downloading, Team Members and Collaborators will have access to do this within the Teams/Projects they’ve been invited to. Reviewers and Presentation recipients will have access to do this within the share link they’ve been sent, as long as downloading is enabled.
​
​**Q: Do I require a Frame.io log-in credential to use Transfer?**
​**A: **No! The Transfer app can be accessed via share links by unauthenticated users. In the same way, un-authenticated users can leave feedback on Review Links. If Transfer is already installed, downloading through the Review or Presentation link (if enabled) will sync via Transfer automatically. 

**Q: Will Transfer allow me to keep multiple downloads going over a long period of time? I don’t want to restart the process with my larger files.**
​**A: **As of the 1.1.0 update, Transfer will be stable for downloads that last over 24 hours, so there should fewer interruptions for longer file transfers. In fact, the app can now process 2x as many simultaneous downloads to increase bandwidth saturation on high-speed networks for even faster delivery of those large batches from Frame.io. 

**Q: Are there any limitations with using Frame.io Transfer with a V4 account?****A: **The only noted limitations at this time are that users cannot yet start downloads in the Transfer App from V4 Web and that Forensic Watermark downloaded files are not supported in V4 at this time.
​**Q: How is privacy handled within Frame.io Transfer?**
​**A:** Privacy restrictions set on any asset or folder level will still apply.
​**Q: What are the minimum requirements to run Frame.io Transfer?**
​**A: **On Macs, the minimum supported OS version is **macOS 10.15 (Catalina) **and later. On PC, **Windows 7 **and later are supported.Related ArticlesFrame.io Transfer: Download and upload files, folders, and projects on your desktopLog file and EDL support in Frame.io TransferWatch Frame.io with the Apple TV AppConnect Frame.io to Adobe LightroomAdobe Premiere Frame.io V4 Panel Overview (25.6 and later)
