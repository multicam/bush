# Editing WorkspacesTo adjust an existing workspace, tap on the three-dots next to the workspace name. You can add users to the workspace, create a new project or rename your workplace.

 

 

**Managing Projects**## Creating ProjectsOh the home page, navigate to your workspace and click on the **three-dot** icon next to the workspace name. On the workspace settings select “Create New Project” and give your project a name.
​ 

A project can be renamed at any point by clicking the three-dots at the top of the project page and clicking “Rename”.
​# Manage Users**Adding Members**Click on the member icon at the top of the page to add new or existing users to the project. If the user is already added to your account, you can search for them by name. If they&#x27;re not already part of your account, you can invite them by email address and select “Add as a new Member” under “New User”.
​
Alternatively, you can also add members from the workspace page by clicking on the** (...) **next to the project name and selecting “Project Members”. 

 

**Removing Users**To remove a user from a project, open the member list at the top of the page and select “Manage Project Members”. Users explicitly added to that project will appear under “Direct Access”. If a user is added to the workspace, they’ll be listed under “Inherited Access”.
​
Clicking on the users name will allow you to adjust their permissions or entirely remove them from the project. 
​## Guest LicensesUsers can view guest licenses in the iOS app however guests cannot be added or removed. Users can manage the licenses in the web browser.
​**Sharing project locations**Another way to invite users to your project space is by sending them a Project URL. This will allow users already in your account quick access to a project you want them involved with. If someone isn’t already added to the account as a member, they won&#x27;t be able to view the project without being given access.
​
Simply open your project settings **(...) **in the correct project and tap **“Sent Project URL”**.
​
Note: If a user is not already added to the account as a paid user, adding them through the link will add another seat to your account.
