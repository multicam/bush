The Frame.io panel allows you to browse, import, upload, manage versions, and work with comments directly inside your edit. This guide outlines the steps to access and use the Frame.io Premiere Panel, with compatibility details for different Premiere Pro versions.

 

**Getting Started ** 

In the panel, select **Sign In** or **Create an Account** to access your Frame.io account. A browser tab will appear for authentication. 

Once signed in, the panel will display your V4 Workspaces, Projects, and folders. 

*Note:** Only V4 accounts are supported in this panel. V3 legacy accounts will appear greyed out.* 

## Browsing &amp; Importing MediaUse the left navigation inside the panel to browse through: 

Workspaces 

Projects 

Folders 

Media 

You can preview supported media and import files directly into your Premiere project. Best of all, your entire Frame.io folder structures can come through perfectly as bins in Premiere. 

#### To import: Select a file → click Import → the asset will appear in your currently selected Premiere bin. 

 

**Export** &amp; Uploading SequencesTo upload your active sequence: 

Select your sequence in the timeline. 

Open the Frame.io panel. 

Click **Export** in the &#x27;Current Sequence&#x27; section of the panel. Set your export name, preset, and upload destination inside your V4 account. 

Click **Export** or choose **Send to Media Encoder**. 
*Note:** When exporting your next version of a cut, the panel with maintain version stacks automatically. You can always turn version stacking off if you want to export to a new file location ***Share **Links 

When a sequence upload finishes, you&#x27;ll see the options to **edit Share Settings **and **Copy Link **at the top of your panel. 

Clicking** Settings **will send you to a new browser tab inside of Frame.io to properly set up a Share link, allowing you to take advantage of Frame.io’s advanced sharing capabilities, such as Share permissions and branding. 

Clicking **Copy Link** is the fastest way to grab the Share link when you&#x27;re ready to send to other Reviewers for feedback. 

You can set link privacy, add people via email, set most security settings, and copy your link to share through whatever messaging platform you prefer. You can open the full share creator experience on web if you find the Share modal too limiting. 

 

**Commenting ** 

Once your video is uploaded, comments will populate in real time from your Share link reviewers. 

 

Inside the panel, you can: 

Add new comments 

Reply to existing comments 

Click any comment to jump your playhead to that moment 

Monitor feedback as it arrives 

You can make your own comments or replies below the comment cards. Clicking a comment card will jump your playhead to the correlating moment in your Premiere Pro timeline. 

 

**Comment Markers** 

Toggle Comment Markers on to display comments directly in your timeline. 
Markers remain anchored to the timeline, minimizing de-sync when editing. 

**Auto-Version Stacking** 

When your sequence changes, the panel will detect edits and prompt you to upload a New Version. 

 

The new version can automatically stack with prior versions in Frame.io, keeping your editorial revisions organized. You can always turn this feature off if you’d prefer to not leverage auto-version stacking. 

 

To manually version stack, click **Export New Version **for a single-button upload of your latest edit.
