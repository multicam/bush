Frame.io produced a 13-episode C2C training series, available now. 

 

In this series, Michael Cioni, along with post-workflow specialist Valentina Vee, take you through the paces of an entire Camera to Cloud workflow.

 

Episode topics range from general education on C2C, to detailed lessons for on-set networking and connecting your Teradek and Sound Devices hardware to Frame.io. 

 

In addition, you’ll learn how Camera to Cloud can enhance your post-production workflow. The second half of the series details specific workflow options for Avid, FCPX, Premiere, Colorfront and Davinci Resolve.
