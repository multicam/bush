**Setup**Power the camera on and open the main menu.

Navigate to the **MAIN MENU – Connectivity** page.In the **Connectivity** menu select** Frame.io, then s**elect the** Setup **option.Follow the on screen prompts to connect the camera to a network (refer to your camera&#x27;s documentation for more information on connecting to networks).

If you are connecting to a network for the first time, or have no current Frame.io Project connected, you will be prompted to get a new pairing code. Select **Get New Pairing Code**.In Frame.io on the web or in the iOS app, navigate to or create the Project you would like to upload to. Follow the pairing instructions in our [Getting Started Guide](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/8896457-c2c-getting-started-with-camera-to-cloud#h_9ccc272c8a) to connect your device to that Project.Once connected to a network and paired to a Project, open the **File Type** option in the **Frame.io Camera to Cloud** menu. Use this menu to select the types of files you would like to send to Frame.io including DNG or JPG for photos and Proxy video. If you have limited bandwidth, try using smaller filetypes. For example, you can use **JPG** instead of **DNG** for photos. Refer to your camera&#x27;s manual for more information about setting up recording types. Press **Back** when done to return to the **Frame.io Camera to Cloud** menu.You can select **Auto Upload **or check **Upload Status. **(**Note: Auto Upload **is set to **On **default).To connect your device to a different Frame.io Project, select the **Project **submenu and you can select **Change Project **or **Logout **if looking to disconnect from the project.
**Troubleshooting****My files are taking a long time to upload**If you have limited bandwidth, try using the **File Format **option in the Frame.io menu. For example, if you&#x27;re shooting stills, you can turn off **DNG** and upload only the smaller **JPG** files. 

You can also turn off **Auto Upload **in the Frame.io menu and then hit the **Play **button to navigate to the individual Images or Videos you want to manually upload by hitting the **Menu **button and selecting **Upload to Frame.io.** 

**My files aren&#x27;t uploading to Frame.io**First, make sure you have a charged battery in the camera body and that the date and time of the camera are up to date.

 

Additionally, make sure **Auto Upload** is set to on and the desired file types (DNG, JPG, Proxy) are selected under **File Format** in the **Frame.io **menu. 

If you would like to choose which images or videos to upload, you can press the **Play** button to navigate to the individual images or videos you would like to manually upload and then press the **Menu** button and select **Upload to Frame.io**. 

**I am only able to upload stills, not video, to Frame.io**On the current firmware, the cloud icon is only displayed on images uploaded to Frame.io. Video upload confirmation is coming soon in a firmware update.

 

**I&#x27;m seeing invalid characters instead of numbers when getting my pairing code**In some rare cases, you may see odd characters instead of numbers when the camera loses its internet connection as it&#x27;s requesting a pairing code from Frame.io. Hit the **BACK** button on the camera body to cancel the connection process. Make sure you have a stable connection and try again.Related ArticlesC2C: Teradek Cube QuickStart GuideC2C: Fujifilm QuickStart GuideC2C: Panasonic Lumix QuickStart GuideC2C: Canon QuickStart GuideC2C: Nikon QuickStart Guide
