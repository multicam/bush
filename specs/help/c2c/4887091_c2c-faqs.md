**How many devices are supported at once?**There is no limit to the number of devices you can connect to your account.

 

**Where do my files go?**C2C Connected Devices upload into a fixed folder structure in your Frame.io project. Once you begin uploading, look for a folder called **Cloud_Devices**. 

**Can I rename my C2C Connected Device?**Yes! Under the **C2C Connections** tab on the web app, mobile web, and the Frame.io iOS app, tap the context menu for the device and select **Rename**. This will reflect in the fixed folder structure. 

**Who can see my C2C Connected Devices files?**All members of a project can see the **Cloud_Devices** folder. You can limit who has access to C2C files by creating a specific C2C Project if needed. 

**How do I disable a C2C Connected Device permanently?**In the C2C Connections tab, navigate to your C2C Connected Devices tab, find the device you want to disable, tap the context menu for device settings, and select **Forget Device**.*Note**: Forgetting a device will remove its authentication with Frame.io. You will have to repeat the setup procedure to reconnect.***How do I disable a C2C Connected Device temporarily?**In the C2C Connections tab, navigate to your C2C Connected Devices tab, find the device you want to disable, tap the context menu for device settings, and select **Pause** **Device**. Pausing a device will prevent the device from uploading until it is resumed. Files recorded while a device is paused will not upload to Frame.io. Currently uploading files will complete. 

**Can I Pause or Forget all C2C Connected Devices on my Project?**In the C2C Connections tab, select devices you would like to pause or forget and then click the pause or forget options accordingly.

 

**What information on my account can a C2C Connected Device access?**None. The C2C Connected Device is completely unaware of your account information. Through the authorization process, Frame.io is aware of the device which is uploading data and routes incoming data to the connected Project.

 

**What account information is stored on a C2C Connected Device?**None. When a C2C Connected Device uploads a file, Frame.io places the file into the Fixed Folder Structure of the bound Project.

 

**How do I get a C2C Connected Device to “forget” my account?**A C2C Connected Device can be removed from an account by Forgetting it in the iOS app. Additionally, expiration can be set that will automatically remove a Connected Device from a Project after a set date and time. No account information is ever stored on a Connected Device. Every C2C Connected Device also has a &quot;Deauthorize&quot; command to remove it from a Project.

 

**What do the various badges in my C2C Connected Devices tab mean?**The **Online** badge indicates that a C2C Connected Device is connected to the internet and is able to upload to Frame.io. The **Offline** badge indicates that a C2C Connected Device is not connected to the internet. The **Paused **badge indicates that a device has been “Paused” by a member of your team. In the “Paused” state, the device won’t upload to Frame.io until it is unpaused. 

**Does using Frame.io C2C require the internet to be on set?**Frame.io C2C requires the internet to upload files to Frame.io and to authorize a device. If internet access is lost during a record, that file will upload once internet connectivity is restored. However, since all files are recorded locally on the C2C Connected Device, they can be manually uploaded if needed as well.

**What happens if I lose my internet connection during a record or an upload?**C2C Connected Devices will keep a queue of files to upload and will upload them once an internet connection is restored. You may see “incomplete” or “queued” files in your Frame.io Project until they are uploaded.

*Note**: If a single asset takes longer than 24 hours to upload, its ability to upload will expire.***How do I get my C2C files to Frame.io if I can’t restore the internet to the C2C Connected Device?**Each C2C Connected device has local storage that can be accessed for manual uploads.

 

**How do I set up my camera to work with an External Video C2C Connected Device?**Your camera must be configured to send record flags and timecode over its video output (SDI or HDMI). Refer to your camera’s support documentation for more information.

**Can I use a wireless transmitter with C2C?**Yes, if the wireless transmitter supports passing through record triggers, timecode, and clipname. Currently, the [Teradek Bolt XT](https://teradek.com/collections/bolt-xt) and the [Teradek Bolt 4K](https://teradek.com/pages/bolt4k) line (Bolt 4K LT, Bolt 4K, and Bolt 4K MAX) support all three. 

**Does Frame.io C2C work with original camera files?**Yes, several cameras support uploading original camera files to Frame.io through C2C.

 

**Do the C2C Audio Connected Devices upload proxies or the original broadcast WAV files to Frame.io?**Each C2C Audio Device can upload either WAV or proxies to Frame.io. This is configurable on the device.

 

**What can I do if my Audio device isn&#x27;t supported?**The Frame.io C2C supported [Viviana Cloud Box](https://www.vivianacloud.com/) can help you upload from Audio devices that don’t have native Frame.io C2C integrations. 

**In Frame.io C2C workflows, what files are made and uploaded from C2C Connected Device?**Files uploaded from C2C Connected Devices depends on the integration. Some cameras can upload original files, while some devices upload proxy files.

**My workflow requires geometry, reframing, extraction, matte, or burn-ins. How do I fit Frame.io C2C proxies into my workflow?**Frame.io C2C can be used in tandem with a traditional dailies workflow. Proxies generated and uploaded to Frame.io by Video C2C Connected Devices are a great solution for the production team to view dailies immediately while off set, for example.

 

Additionally, because proxies generated by Video C2C Connected Devices share timecode and clipnames with the corresponding camera original file, they can be used until the OCF arrives at the lab. There are [many ways](https://blog.frame.io/2021/07/26/cloud-connected-production-saves-time-money/) C2C can enhance your particular workflow.

**How do I use Frame.io C2C to record over-cranked/slow-motion/offspeed shots with SDI cameras?**Frame.io is working hard to expand features over time. Due to the limitations of downstream SDI recording, any over-cranked/slow-motion/offspeed shots will be recorded in “real-time” and playback as such on Frame.io.

 

**How do I control who can see dailies being uploaded to Frame.io C2C?**Frame.io C2C files are placed in a **Cloud_Devices** folder in your Project, which can be seen by all members of the Project. If you would like to restrict that further, you can create a Project that&#x27;s only for Frame.io C2C and restrict the colleagues that join it. Frame.io C2C files can also be shared as Share Links. 

**Can I upload all my cameras into the same folder in the Fixed Folder Structure, instead of having them split up by device?**C2C Connected Devices upload into the Fixed Folder Structure in order to maintain organization and reduce setup complications. However, once assets have been uploaded to Frame.io C2C, they can be used just like any other asset. This means they can be moved, copied, or shared as usual.
