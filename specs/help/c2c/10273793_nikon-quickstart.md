[NX MobileAir](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nikon.nxmoba) for Android version 1.4 or newer or [NX MobileAir](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nx-mobileair/id1561345097) for iOS version 1.4.1 or newer installed on your smartphoneProperly formatted SD card for your camera

Internet access (local network, hot spot, or smartphone tether)

Access to Frame.io or the Frame.io iOS app

A Frame.io Project

*Specific to Frame.io Legacy accounts:*Ensure C2C Connections are enabled in your project settings

Ensure you have C2C Device management permissions within the account the project is hosted in

 

**Setup**Power on the camera and ensure it is set to the correct date, time, and timezone. Connect the camera to your smartphone using one of the following interfaces: connect directly via USB-C, connect both your smartphone and your camera to the same WiFi network, or connect your camera to your smartphone&#x27;s hot spot. Refer to your camera&#x27;s manual for more information about connecting to the NX MobileAir app.

Once one of the above connections are made between your camera and smartphone, launch the NX MobileAir app on your smartphone. The NX MobileAir app should automatically detect your camera and prompt you to allow connection.

Now that the camera is connected, click the three dot menu on the NX MobileAir app homepage where you’ll see an option for Frame.io. Click through the Frame.io menu option to generate a 6-digit pairing code.

In Frame.io on the web or in the iOS app, navigate to or create the Project you would like to upload to. Follow the pairing instructions in our [Getting Started Guide](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/8896457-c2c-getting-started-with-camera-to-cloud#h_9ccc272c8a) to connect your device to that Project.If you are uploading video, navigate to the **Recording Menu** on the camera and configure your format for C2C upload. At this time, only H.264 &amp; H265 formats are supported for C2C upload.Once your video or stills format is selected, configure your desired capture frame size and frame rate.

Auto Transfer will be enabled by default, meaning that your selected File Format (MOV, MP4, RAW, or JPEG) will automatically upload to your authenticated project once a clip is recorded. To manually select and upload images to Frame.io, you can turn this function off.

At this time, only original file formats will be supported for C2C upload. With this in mind, consider the upload bandwidth of your chosen internet connection when deciding which file format may be best for your needs. Refer to our[ Internet Connection Guide](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/8571967-c2c-complete-internet-connection-guide) for more information on considerations around internet connection.
 

**Troubleshooting****I have an iOS smartphone and am not seeing the ability to configure Camera to Cloud in the NX MobileAir app**Make sure you&#x27;re using NX MobileAir for iOS version 1.4.1 or newer. C2C is not supported in older versions of the iOS app.

 

## My upload queue vanished — what happened?Please be aware that your upload stops if you:

Lose your internet connection

Unplug the USB-C cable

Exit the Frame.io screen on the NX MobileAir app

Turn off your camera

Please use “Select files to transfer” to manually upload any files that were removed from the queue.

 

## I&#x27;m on iOS and I&#x27;m not seeing an upload queuePlease be aware that offline queues are not available on the iOS app when using WiFi to connect to your camera. To use offline queues, please connect your iPhone to your camera with USB-C.

 

**My uploads aren&#x27;t working — what should I check?**If you notice that your uploads are not working, we recommend trying these two simple fixes that will hopefully resolve your issues. 

Check your internet connection. Check out our [Internet Connection Guide](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/8571967-c2c-complete-internet-connection-guide) for more information.Confirm that you are using a fast USB-C cable.

## My Z8&#x27;s upload queue is stuck on iOSIf your Z8&#x27;s upload queue gets stuck uploading, disconnect the phone and camera from USB-C and reconnect. If you are connecting your iPhone to your camera with WiFi, close and reopen the NX MobileAir app.

 

## I can&#x27;t connect NX MobileAir to my Z8 with WiFiMake sure you update your camera to firmware version 3.00 or later to use WiFi. Older firmware supports USB-C only.

 

**My camera isn&#x27;t showing up in the NX MobileAir app while in WiFi mode — why?**There are two main reasons why your camera may not be showing up when in WiFi mode.

Your camera and phone need to be on the same WiFi network

Mesh networks often cause problems. We recommend that you use a single access point (like GLiNet) instead. For more information, please refer to the [Internet Connection Guide](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/8571967-c2c-complete-internet-connection-guide).
**When using USB-C, what&#x27;s the best way to physically attach my smartphone to my camera?**There are several options available, depending on your preferences. We recommend that you use a dedicated phone mount for a seamless experience.

**How do I resend failed uploads?**At this time, there is not a retry button. If you would like to resend files, please use “Select files to transfer” to send them again.

 

## My files aren&#x27;t uploading when I leave the NX MobileAir app for iOSWhen connecting your iPhone to your camera with USB-C, the NX MobileAir app must remain in the foreground. Uploads will pause if the app is closed or minimized. Background uploading is supported when your iPhone is connected to your camera with WiFi.

 

## My camera disconnects when I leave the NX MobileAir app for iOSWhen connecting your iPhone to your camera with USB-C, the NX MobileAir app must remain in the foreground. If you need to use MFA to sign in to Frame.io, make sure you&#x27;re signed in to Frame.io on the web or in the Frame.io app before connecting a camera.

 

## My stills aren&#x27;t uploading on AndroidWhen setting up the connection to the camera, make sure to not opt to save the images either to the NX MobileAir app or to the Android phone. Selecting either option will prevent NX MobileAir from uploading to Frame.io.

 

**While using the USB-C connection, my camera and smartphone get disconnected**Please use a USB-C cable recommended by Nikon. For more information on recommended cables, please refer your camera&#x27;s documentation

 

**While using the USB-C connection, my smartphone&#x27;s battery depletes quickly**If your smartphone&#x27;s battery is depleting quickly, your camera may be drawing power from your smartphone over USB-C. You can disable USB power on your camera by opening the main menu by pushing the `Menu` button on the camera, then navigating to the **Set Up Menu** (wrench icon). Toggle **USB power delivery** to **OFF**. 

**Note**: you may not be able to charge your camera via USB-C while this setting is toggled OFF. You&#x27;ll need to use a charger.Related ArticlesC2C: Teradek Cube QuickStart GuideC2C: Fujifilm QuickStart GuideC2C: Panasonic Lumix QuickStart GuideC2C: Canon QuickStart GuideC2C: Leica QuickStart Guide
