**Watch the Collections Overview tutorial****Collections** are a new way to automatically group and spotlight specific folders or assets by leveraging the metadata you’ve created. Use them for your organization, or send a Collection out as a unique and curated saved search of your media to others with real-time updating. 
​
Collections can be found directly below your assets in the Navigation panel. Click the plus button to start creating your first Collection. All other saved Collections will appear underneath for you to keep track of. Begin customizing the Collection as you would in your project space or share options.
​## Understanding CollectionsLet’s use an example that you are using the Ratings metadata in your project and you want to collect all of the 5-star reviews to send to a client. Collections are a great way to create and maintain this view without needing to make filtering adjustments for anyone inside of your project, creating an isolated organization space for your media. 

 

Filtering works for you to see all assets within a Project with those ratings, but there may be more inside other folders of that Project that may take a bit of digging to see, and you don’t want to move them out of their proper locations into a new Share folder. With Collections, we can make all those assets appear and be saved in one easy-to-find location.

 

 

First, start by choosing a source. Aside from the main Project, folders can be available to choose from once you are inside of them. The new Collection is now created and you apply those same filter settings in this unique view. Retitling the Collection to “5-Star Reviews” will let others know this is the go-to Collection to see the highest-rated assets without having to change the main Project view or move items around. This can now be viewed by anyone who has access to this Project.
​## FilterThe Filter option is the best way to create a view that focuses on assets that need your attention in your Collection. Click on Filter, then Add Filter, and select a field option.
​
Let’s say once again that you’re a user who needs to see all the 5-star rating assets for review. Pick your Rating Field, and select the parameters (“equal to” and “5 stars”). Now the view of your assets will only be those with 5-star ratings, making it easy to know what items in a Project or folder to focus on. The same concept applies to single-line text and single-select items as well as the rest of the available Fields. Adding more filters will make your results more specific. 

## List viewCollections is the best place to view all your assets in a list view format as well. In the Appearance tab, select between Grid view and List view. While Grid view is a more visual option, List view highlights more details in a compact column format than the previous selection, which can be the preferred view for a Collection with a large number assets to scroll through.

*Note: **Keep in mind the difference between when your Appearance options whether you are in a Team (public) or Private Collection. *
​
​Team Collections are visible to all project members and any changes made to your project appearance will be reflected to all project members. A message will be seen at the top of the Appearance tab to clarify this.
​
Private Collections are only visible to you and therefore any changes made in the Collection will only reflect changes for you.Related ArticlesPanel OverviewMetadata OverviewCreating Folders and Restricted FoldersEnhanced search with media intelligenceAdobe Workfront Integration Overview
