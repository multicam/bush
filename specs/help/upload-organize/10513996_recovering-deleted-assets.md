If you want to remove any assets, version stacks, or folders out of your projects, click on the three-dot menu and select **Delete**. You&#x27;ll now see a new **Recently Deleted **section appear below your list of projects and folders. 

 

When inside this page, you can view all your previously deleted assets, version stacks, and folders for the Workspace you are in. Highlight any of the ones you want to restore by clicking on the three-dot menu and selecting **Restore**. Restore entire folders and version stacks or open individual ones up to restore as well. 

You can also view the time badge on any asset to see how long it has before it is removed from the Recently Deleted page. Every asset and folder has a 30-day timer starting from when it is initially deleted. Once the timer runs out, it will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered anymore.
