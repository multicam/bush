## Workspaces 

The landing page of the Frame.io web app is called the **Homepage **and it&#x27;s where you can browse all your other Workspaces and Projects you have access to in an account. *Note:** Workspaces were previously known as &quot;Teams&quot; in Frame.io. The functionality of the Workspace is identical to the previous &quot;Team&quot; structure.***All Projects **is where you will start when first opening to or clicking on the Homepage icon. This will display all Projects from every Workspace available to you on one page. Under the title of each Project will show the name of the Workspace is comes from to easily track its location. 

All available Workspaces (if you have more than one) will be seen on the left of your screen in a more compact view. Clicking into your Workspace will open up its own dedicated landing page of the Projects in your account that exist only inside of that Workspace.

 

You can adjust Workspace sorting views, enable notifications, access Workspace settings from the three-dot menu for the Workspace. You can also invite or manage users in your Workspace by clicking the purple people icon.

 

## Create a ProjectCreate a new Project by navigating to your workspace and clicking the **New Project (+) **box under your Workspace.​*Note: **You will need to be an Owner, Content Admin, or a user who has been invited to the Workspace to be able to create a new Project.* 

This will allow you to name your new project, select a project template, or create it from scratch. If you’d like to provide test files for your users, you can toggle on “include sample assets”.

 

### Project TemplatesA project template is like a ready-made blueprint for your projects in Frame.io, complete with all the necessary elements to get you started with common creative workflows quickly and smoothly. Choose one of our 12 templates, which each come with sample assets, folder structure, custom metadata, and collections. Project templates are available to you each time you start a new project.

 

## Project Privacy*Note:** This feature is for users on a &quot;Team&quot; plan or higher. *Owners, Admins and Full Access members on a Workspace can set Projects to be **Internal** or **Restricted** during creation in Project Settings or in Account Settings. 

 

Toggling **Make Restricted** on will make the Project only visible to those directly invited to the Project only, in addition to any Admins within a Workspace. If unselected, the Project will be visible to anyone who has access to the Workspace it belongs to or if they&#x27;re invited directly into the Project. 

The privacy setting you choose can be updated after it’s been created as well in your Project Settings.

 

 

*Note:** Any Private Projects you have in a Legacy (V3) account will be converted into Invite-Only Projects in V4 with the same users having access.* ## FAQ**Q: Can I create my own templates?****A: **You cannot create your own templates at this time. However, you can now duplicate generic projects to serve as pseudo-template for your team to reference when creating new projects. 

**Q: How do I duplicate a regular project?****A: **On your workspaces page, click on the three dot menu on any project and click **Duplicate project**. From here, you will be able to rename the new project and determine whether to copy just the project structure, or whether to include project assets as well.
​**Q: Are any features here named differently in V4? ****A: **&quot;Teams&quot; are now called &quot;Workspaces&quot; &quot;Public projects&quot; are now called &quot;Internal Projects&quot; 

&quot;Private Projects&quot; are now called &quot;Restricted Projects&quot;

&quot;Archived Projects&quot; are now called &quot;Inactive Projects&quot;
