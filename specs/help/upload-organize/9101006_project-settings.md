When creating a project, all users with access to the workspace will inherit access to the project too. Adding a user to a project explicitly will restrict their access to that project only. You can add as many users to a project as you need unless they are a Guest user.
​
To access the project settings, you can click on the **(...) three-dot menu **on the project icon. 

 

From here, you can toggle **Project Notifications**, **Duplicate Project**, or **Project Settings.** 

**Project Notifications** can be toggled on to receive all in-app notifications for actions that take place inside that project (new comments, new uploads, etc.). To choose where you want your projects notifications sent to, access your Profile Settings under the Notifications tab. Toggling this option off will turn off all of the same notifications entirely from that project (with the exception of @ mentions). 

**Duplicate Project** will create an identical copy of your project inside of your workspace. The project will not include existing users, comments, or Shares when duplicated. The option to copy your assets over will be available in a tick box before you create the duplicate. 

**Project Settings** are available to add a project name and select a project logo. 

#### Project Privacy*Note:** This feature is for users on a &quot;Team&quot; plan or higher. *Owners, Admins and Full Access members on a Workspace can set Projects to be **Internal** or **Restricted** during creation in Project Settings or in Account Settings. 

Toggling **Make Restricted** on will make the Project only visible to those directly invited to the Project only, in addition to any Admins within a Workspace. If unselected, the Project will be visible to anyone who has access to the Workspace it belongs to or if they&#x27;re invited directly into the Project. 

The privacy setting you choose can be updated after it’s been created as well in your Project Settings.
