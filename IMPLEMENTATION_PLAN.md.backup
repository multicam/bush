## PARALLEL WORKSTREAMS

These four workstreams can run simultaneously with minimal dependencies, accelerating progress from Iteration 0 to Iteration 1.

### Stream 1: Backend Foundation
**Owner**: Backend engineer
**Timeline**: Days 1-14

```
Days 1-3:  R2 Research → Bootstrap (1.1) → Object Storage (1.6)
Days 4-7:  Database Schema (1.2) ← R1 findings incorporated
Days 8-14: Authentication (1.3) → Permissions (1.4) → API (1.5)
```

**Key outputs**:
- Deployed development environment

```
Days 1-3:  specs/12-authentication.md, specs/19-accessibility.md
Days 4-7:  specs/11-security-features.md (expansion), specs/13-billing-and-plans.md
Days 8-10: specs/15-media-processing.md (after R4 starts)
```

**Key outputs**:
- 5 critical spec documents completed
- Unblocks Phase 1-3 implementation

**Dependencies**: R4 (for specs/15), otherwise independent

### Stream 3: Research
**Owner**: Senior engineer / architect
**Timeline**: Days 1-21 (overlapping)

```
Days 1-2:  R2 (Deployment) [CRITICAL - blocks Bootstrap]
Days 1-6:  R1 (SQLite) [CRITICAL - informs Schema]
Days 7-14: R4 (Media Transcoding) [HIGH - blocks Processing]
Days 7-21: R5 (Large File Upload) [MEDIUM - basic upload works without]
Days 14-21: R7 (Real-Time Infrastructure) [MEDIUM - blocks Comments later]
```

**Key outputs**:
- Deployment architecture decision
- SQLite configuration and backup strategy
- FFmpeg parameter matrix
- Upload protocol specification

**Dependencies**: None (can all start immediately)

### Stream 4: Frontend Shell
**Owner**: Frontend engineer
**Timeline**: Days 3-14

```
Days 3-7:   Start Web Shell (1.7) - static structure
Days 8-10:  Continue shell - auth flows UI
Days 11-14: Connect to API, complete interactive shell
```

**Key outputs**:
- Next.js app with routing and auth flows
- Multi-panel layout
- State management infrastructure

**Dependencies**: Bootstrap (1.1) day 3, API (1.5) day 11 for full functionality

### Parallelization Benefits

**Traditional Sequential Approach**:
- Phase 1: ~6 weeks
- Total to Iteration 1 (with basic upload): ~10 weeks

**Parallel Workstreams Approach**:
- Phase 1: ~2.5 weeks (through overlap)
- Total to Iteration 1: ~4 weeks (60% faster)

**Critical Success Factors**:
1. R2 must complete by Day 2 (blocks all backend work)
2. R1 findings incorporated into schema by Day 6 (prevents rework)
3. Spec writers stay 3-5 days ahead of implementation
4. Frontend builds static shell while backend builds API (merge at Day 11)

## RISK REGISTER

### Risk 1: SQLite Performance at Scale
**Severity**: HIGH
**Probability**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Could require architectural change mid-project

**Description**: SQLite may not handle production workload (concurrent writes, large datasets, multi-instance deployment).

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Complete R1 research by Day 6 with realistic benchmarks
- Design schema with PostgreSQL migration path from day one
- Use Drizzle ORM (supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL)
- Establish trigger criteria: if >500 concurrent users or >100GB database, plan migration
- Budget 2 weeks for PostgreSQL migration if triggered

**Monitoring**: Track query latency, connection pool saturation, write lock contention in production

### Risk 2: No-Container Deployment Complexity
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Probability**: LOW
**Impact**: Operational complexity, harder scaling, limited hosting options

**Description**: Deploying Bun + Next.js + FFmpeg workers + Redis without Docker increases configuration complexity and limits platform options.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Complete R2 research by Day 2 to validate chosen approach
- Document every deployment step in runbook
- Use infrastructure-as-code (Terraform or similar) even without containers
- Establish monitoring and alerting from day one
- Consider gradual migration to containerless platforms (Fly.io, Render) with native support

**Monitoring**: Track deployment success rate, time-to-deploy, configuration drift

### Risk 3: Bun Production Maturity
**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Probability**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Runtime crashes, memory leaks, limited community support, ecosystem gaps

**Description**: Bun is relatively new (v1.0 in 2023). Production stability unknown at scale.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Build comprehensive error handling and crash recovery (process supervision)
- Implement health checks and automatic restarts
- Monitor Bun GitHub issues and Discord for production users
- Plan Node.js fallback: design API to be runtime-agnostic (avoid Bun-specific APIs where possible)
- Budget 1 week for Node.js migration if Bun proves unstable

**Monitoring**: Track runtime crashes, memory growth, unhandled promise rejections, dependency compatibility issues

### Risk 4: Over-Engineered for MVP
**Severity**: LOW
**Probability**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Delayed MVP launch, wasted effort on premature optimization

**Description**: Implementing enterprise features (Access Groups, forensic watermarking, SAML) before validating core product-market fit.

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Defer Phase 5 (Enterprise) until post-launch feedback
- Implement Phase 3 features only after Phase 2 MVP validates market need
- Use feature flags to ship incrementally
- Prioritize Phase 2 completion over Phase 3 polish
- Timebox each feature: if exceeding estimate by 50%, descope or defer

**Monitoring**: Track time-to-MVP, feature usage analytics post-launch, customer feedback on must-have vs nice-to-have

**Key Dependency Corrections**:

1. **R2 no longer blocks 1.1 (Bootstrap)**: Deployment research informs project structure but doesn't prevent starting
2. **R1 no longer blocks 1.2 (Schema) design**: SQLite research informs configuration (WAL mode, connection pooling), not initial schema design
3. **R5 no longer blocks 2.1 (Upload)**: Basic upload works with 10MB chunks, 3-parallel; R5 optimizes for 5TB files
4. **1.6 (Storage) no longer depends on R1 or R5**: Basic S3-compatible storage implementation doesn't require scale research
5. **1.5 (API) no longer depends on R2**: Deployment architecture handled in Bootstrap phase

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Start Here)

**Updated**: 2026-02-16
**Timeline**: Days 1-28 (4 weeks to Iteration 1)

This replaces the previous sequential 7-item list with a parallelized 18-item action plan organized by timeline. All items are NOT STARTED.

### Days 1-3: Foundation Launch

1. ✅ **Complete R2 (Deployment without Containers)** [2 days, CRITICAL]
   - Research Bun production deployment, evaluate hosting platforms
   - Document deployment architecture, process supervision, zero-downtime strategy
   - Deliverable: Deployment architecture document

2. ✅ **Write specs/12-authentication.md** [1 day]
   - Document SAML/SSO flows, session policies, MFA, token rotation
   - Unblocks: Phase 1.3 (Authentication)

3. ✅ **Write specs/19-accessibility.md** [1 day]
   - Define WCAG compliance target, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
   - Informs: All UI work from Phase 1.7 onward

4. ✅ **Start R1 (SQLite at Scale)** [3 days, completes Day 6]
   - Benchmark concurrency, test WAL mode, evaluate connection pooling
   - Findings incorporated into Database Schema configuration by Day 6

5. ✅ **Bootstrap Project (1.1)** [1 day, starts Day 3 after R2]
   - Initialize monorepo, TypeScript, linting, testing, CI/CD
   - Blocks: Everything else

### Days 3-7: Core Infrastructure

6. ✅ **Set up Object Storage (1.6)** [1 day]
   - Implement S3-compatible interface, choose provider (R2 or B2)
   - No longer blocked by R1 or R5 -- basic storage works immediately

7. ✅ **Design Database Schema (1.2)** [2 days, Days 4-7]
   - Create SQLite schema, configure ORM, migrations, seed data
   - R1 findings incorporated into configuration by Day 6

8. ✅ **Expand specs/11-security-features.md** [1 day]
   - Add forensic watermarking, audit logs, Access Groups, security policies
   - Informs: Permission system (1.4)

9. ✅ **Write specs/13-billing-and-plans.md** [1 day]
   - Define pricing, plan matrix, tier boundaries, quota enforcement
   - Blocks: Phase 3.7, Phase 5.1

10. ✅ **Start Web App Shell (1.7)** [3 days, completes Week 2]
    - Initialize Next.js, build auth flows UI, core pages, static shell
    - Can start before API -- connect to API in Week 2

### Week 2 (Days 8-14): Auth, Permissions, API

11. ✅ **Build Authentication System (1.3)** [3 days]
    - Email/password, OAuth 2.0, 2FA, Redis sessions, JWT tokens
    - Depends on: Database Schema (1.2), specs/12-authentication.md

12. ✅ **Build Permission System (1.4)** [2 days]
    - Five permission levels, inheritance, middleware, edge-case tests
    - Depends on: Database (1.2), Authentication (1.3)

13. ✅ **Build API Foundation (1.5)** [3 days]
    - Bun HTTP server, OAuth middleware, rate limiting, CRUD routes, OpenAPI
    - Depends on: Authentication (1.3), Permissions (1.4)

14. ✅ **Complete Web App Shell (1.7)** [2 days]
    - Connect to API, multi-panel layout, navigation, responsive design
    - Depends on: API (1.5), Authentication (1.3)

15. ✅ **Start R4 (Media Transcoding Pipeline)** [started Day 7, completes Day 14]
    - Benchmark FFmpeg, design worker architecture, test HDR/RAW/Adobe
    - Blocks: specs/15-media-processing.md (Week 2), then Phase 2.2

### Week 3-4 (Days 15-28): Upload, Processing, Browser

16. ✅ **Write specs/15-media-processing.md** [1 day, after R4]
    - Document FFmpeg parameters, timeouts, HDR/RAW/Adobe specs
    - Blocks: Phase 2.2 implementation

17. ✅ **Build File Upload System (2.1)** [3 days]
    - Chunked upload, queue UI, folder preservation, constraints
    - Basic implementation (10MB chunks, 3-parallel) works without R5
    - Depends on: API (1.5), Storage (1.6), Web Shell (1.7)

18. ✅ **Build Media Processing Pipeline (2.2)** [4 days]
    - BullMQ, thumbnails, filmstrips, proxy transcoding, FFprobe metadata
    - Depends on: Upload (2.1), Storage (1.6), specs/15-media-processing.md

19. ✅ **Build Asset Browser (2.3)** [3 days]
    - Grid/list views, sorting, filtering, multi-select, bulk actions
    - Depends on: API (1.5), Upload (2.1), Processing (2.2)

**By Day 28 (Week 4 End)**: Phase 1 complete + basic upload/processing/browsing = **Iteration 1 Achieved**

### Next Priorities (Beyond Iteration 1)

20. Complete Phase 2.4-2.12 (Asset Operations, Version Stacking, Viewers, Comments, Metadata, Search)
21. Start Phase 3 (Sharing, Collections, Transcription, Webhooks)
22. Defer Phase 4-5 until post-MVP feedback

**All other work depends on the above 19 items being completed in order.**
