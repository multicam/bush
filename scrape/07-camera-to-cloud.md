# Frame.io - Camera to Cloud (C2C)

## Summary
Camera to Cloud enables instant upload of media from the set the moment recording stops. The rest of the team doesn't have to be at the shoot to be part of it.

## Core Concept
Takes from the set are instantly uploaded the moment the director yells "cut." So the rest of the team doesn't have to be at the shoot to be part of it.
