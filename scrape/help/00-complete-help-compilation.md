## What is a User?

### Account Owner/Content Admin
A Content Admin has access to all public Projects in your Workspace(s). Most supplemental features a Content Admin has can be found in their expanded Account Settings, including user and Project management. As many Content Admins can be added as needed. They will take up User seats on your active plan.

An Account Owner has all of the same features as a Content Admin with the exception of Billing and Plan management. There can also only be one Account Owner per account.

**Best use cases:** team leads, post supervisors, project managers

### Member
A Member is an account-level user with their own login and password who will have access to whichever Workspace or Projects are assigned to them. Instead of wider access similar to Account Owner or Content Admin, Members are given access at the level in which they are invited.

**Best use cases:** co-workers, asset managers, post-production team, anyone responsible for the upkeep of your account

### Reviewer
A Reviewer is a user whose sole purpose is for reviewing or viewing content shared with them through a Share link. They will not have a login/password for Frame.io but can freely access the media that is sent to them. They do not have to sign up to access the media, nor do you have to pay to send it to them; it's **100% free**.

**Best use cases:** clients, producers, friends/family, anyone that needs to approve the progress of your edit

### Guest User
A Guest User is a unique type of user that is free of charge with access inside of your account (unlike a Reviewer who has no access to your account and only has external links for viewing your media), but their access is limited to only a single Project at a time.

**Note:** Guest Users are only available on select Free and Pro plans.

## How do I leave comments?

### Single Frame / Single Page Comment
To comment on a specific frame/page of a video or PDF, create a single-frame or single-page comment. While watching a video, pause playback on the frame you wish to leave a comment, write the comment in the comment box below the player, and click Send. Your comment will now be linked to this exact frame making it easy for any video editor to know where a revision needs to be made.

### Range-Based Comment
If you're looking to comment on a specific section of the video, such as a full scene, create a range-based comment. Begin leaving a comment the same way as before, then drag the bracket of the yellow indicator in the play bar to highlight the range you want to be covered. Click Send now and the comment line will be stretched and highlight the entire section, exactly down to the frame.

### Anchored Comment
New to Frame.io V4, anchored comments allow you to click on the asset viewer at any point during playback to leave a comment. This also offers the option to point out a specific spot on the viewer as to what your feedback may be referring to. This comment type can be used on video files, images, PDFs, and files from Adobe Photoshop & Adobe Illustrator. A pin icon will be next to the comment when delivered.

---

## How do I use metadata?

Metadata makes it easier than ever to organize and view your media assets based on how you and your team work.

Use the dropdown **Fields** menu to see the most important information about your assets directly on the asset card. There are 32 out-of-the-box metadata fields to choose from. Some fields are read only, such as Audio Codec, while some are essentials to help you get started with common workflows such as the Status field.

Toggle the switch in the Fields dropdown menu to activate any Field on your assets within that Project.

### Built-in Metadata Fields

**Video/Audio Technical:**
- Alpha Channel, Audio Bit Depth, Audio Bit Rate, Audio Codec, Bit Depth, Bit Rate, Channels, Color Space, Duration, Dynamic Range, End Time, Frame Rate, Resolution - Height, Resolution - Width, Sample Rate, Start Time, Video Bit Rate, Video Codec

**File Information:**
- Date Uploaded, File Size, File Type, Format, Page Count, Source Filename

**Collaboration:**
- Assignee, Comment Count, Keywords, Notes, Rating, Seen By, Status, Transcript, Uploader

### Custom Metadata Fields

Create your own custom fields using the dropdown Fields menu and choose **Manage fields** or **New +**. Custom field types include:
- Text
- Number
- Date
- Single-select
- Multi-select
- Checkbox
- User reference
- URL
- Rating

The **Sorted By** option lets you choose one or multiple sort options based on your fields.

# 2. Upload and Organize

## Workspace Overview

When you navigate to next.frame.io (or click the home 🏠 icon in-app), you'll land inside your **Workspace**. This is your hub where to organize all of your Projects.

From here, create a new Project by navigating to your Workspace and clicking the **New Project (+)** box. Activate Project privacy if you wish to control Project access. Make sure to try out our Project templates for quick Project and asset creation.

### Hierarchy

```
Account
└── Workspace (Enterprise)
    └── Project
        └── Folder
            └── Asset / Version Stack
```

## Project Settings

When creating a project, all users with access to the workspace will inherit access to the project too. Adding a user to a project explicitly will restrict their access to that project only.

To access the project settings, click on the **(...) three-dot menu** on the project icon.

From here, you can toggle:
- **Project Notifications** - Receive all in-app notifications for actions in that project
- **Duplicate Project** - Create an identical copy (without users, comments, or Shares)
- **Project Settings** - Add project name and select a project logo

### Project Privacy (Team plan or higher)

Owners, Admins and Full Access members on a Workspace can set Projects to be **Internal** or **Restricted**.

Toggling **Make Restricted** on will make the Project only visible to those directly invited to the Project only, in addition to any Admins within a Workspace.

---

## Uploading Your Media

Frame.io will accept any file uploaded to your Project. File types that support viewers and reviewing features include all common video, image, audio, PDF, and Microsoft Office file types.

### Upload Methods

1. **Drag and drop** - Drag file or folder anywhere onto the project page
2. **Menu option** - Select **+ > File upload** or **Folder upload** on the top right

If you choose to upload folders, Frame.io will retain the folder structure automatically!

### Upload Specifications

| Specification | Limit |
|---------------|-------|
| Max file size | 5TB |
| Max concurrent uploads | 10 |
| Max assets per upload | 500 |
| Max folders per upload | 250 |

Frame.io uses an accelerated file uploader, which allows for speeds up to 5 times faster than the top file-sharing services.

Frame.io encodes the files into HTML5 videos to play seamlessly on the web while still storing the original file to download at any time. You can upload up to 500 assets or 250 folders at a time, 10 concurrent uploads can occur.

### Watch Folders (Mac App)

The Mac app can monitor folders on your computer and automatically upload their contents to a specific project.

---

## Creating Folders and Restricted Folders

### Creating Folders

To create a folder in a project, click on the **(+)** icon and select **New Folder**. Enter your folder name and press Enter. 

You can also create folders within existing folders. There is no limit to the amount of nested folders you can have.

### Restricted Folders

**Available on Team plan or higher**

Restricted folders are only visible to people directly invited. Restricted folders break the inheritance chain from the parent resource, so you can choose to add any users back into their restricted projects if needed.

**Note:** Owners and Content Admins retain access to all resources, even restricted ones.

---

## Collections Overview

Collections are a great way to view assets based on metadata criteria. When you have a large amount of assets across a project or workspace, collections can help you find what you're looking for without having to sift through each folder.

### Creating a Collection

1. Navigate to the Project panel
2. Click the **+** icon next to Collections
3. Enter a name for your Collection
4. Set filter rules (e.g., Status is "In Progress")
5. The Collection will automatically include assets that match your criteria

### Team vs Private Collections

- **Team Collection** - Visible to all project members
- **Private Collection** - Visible only to you

### Collection Features

- Dynamic filtering with saved filter configurations
- Real-time sync with source assets
- Share Collections externally

---

## Version Stacking

Version stacking allows you to group multiple versions of an asset together, making it easy to track progress and compare changes.

### How to Create a Version Stack

1. Drag a new version onto an existing asset
2. The new file becomes Version 2
3. Continue adding versions as needed

### Version Stack Features

- Automatic version numbering
- View all versions in stack
- Compare versions
- Download specific version

---

## Copying and Moving Media

### Copy To
The **Copy To** option allows you to copy single files, multiple files, or entire folders to different locations without removing them from the original source.

### Move To
The **Move To** option relocates assets from one location to another.

### Bulk Operations
