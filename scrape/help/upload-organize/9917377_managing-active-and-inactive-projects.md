In Frame.io V4, anyone, regardless of role, has the option to set projects as either **Active **or **Inactive** as a way to better manage project visibility and get rid of project clutter. 

**Active Projects** are any standard projects that can be interacted with if given proper access. 

**Inactive projects** are like any project with the notable exception that they are filtered out by default on the workspace to help members more easily scan for active projects. In this aspect, they are similar to Archived Projects from Frame.io Legacy. 
​ 
To change the state of your Project, go to the Project&#x27;s three-dot menu in the Workspace page and select **Mark Inactive, **or **Mark Active **to reverse the setting. An **Inactive **tag will show once set. 

 

By default, Inactive projects will filter out of view from your Workspace. If you want them to be seen, go to the Workspace&#x27;s three-dot menu and change the **Filter by All Projects **options to All projects, Active projects only, or Inactive projects only. 

*Note:** Inactive projects will remain fully editable and will appear in the Project Switcher and the Move/Copy to menus. Notifications will still be sent if Inactive projects are edited.*​ You can also bulk change your projects to Active projects or Inactive projects within Account Settings. In the Projects tab in your Accounts Settings, click on the tick mark of one or multiple projects to change switch its Projects status to either Active or Inactive (you can only change Projects to one type of status if selecting multiple Projects at once).
​ 

Click the action button on the bottom-right, which will say either **Mark Inactive** or **Mark Active** depending on the status of the Project(s) you have selected.
​## FAQ**Q: What will happen to my archived projects in Legacy when I update to V4?** **A: **Upon migration from Legacy to V4, all Legacy archived projects will become V4 Inactive projects. You can access these through a global filter on the Workspace page, which allows switching between active and inactive projects. Inactive projects remain within their original parent workspace. 

**Q: Will my Inactive projects count towards my active storage?** 
​**A: **If your account doesn’t have access to archived storage, inactive projects will use up your active storage space. For accounts with archival storage, inactive projects will be counted toward that type of storage instead.
