Create Version Stacks to organize your clips&#x27; revisions rather than having multiple versions as individual files in your project. 
​
To create a Version Stack, upload the new version, then drag it on top of the original version.
​
Be sure the new version has fully uploaded before creating your Version Stack.
​
Once you&#x27;ve created the Version Stack, double-click to open in the Player Page, the newest version will be ready to view.
​
Access all of the versions by clicking the version number at the top of the page. You can view any previous version in that stack.
​**Version Management****Reorder versions within your version stack**On the project page, click the menu options on your version stack by clicking the three dots - select **manage version stack.**
​
From here, you can drag and drop the versions into the order you want
​
To quickly manage the version stack, you can click on the version icon on the asset from within the project page.
​**Remove a version from a stack**Click the menu options on your version stack by clicking the three dots - select **manage version stack,** click the **...** button next to the version and select &quot;**Remove from stack**.&quot;
