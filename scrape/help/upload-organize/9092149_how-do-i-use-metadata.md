**Metadata** makes it easier than ever to organize and view your media assets based on how you and your team work. 
You can create an entirely customized view of your assets and what’s important to you by utilizing the metadata fields in your Project. 

 
Use the dropdown **Fields **menu to see the most important information about your assets directly on the asset card. This will make organizing and management of your files easier and more accurate. There are 32 out-of-the-box metadata fields to choose from. Some fields are read only, such as Audio Codec, while some are essentials to help you get started with common workflows such as the Status field. Toggle the switch in the Fields dropdown menu to activate any Field on your assets within that Project. 

Fields will also be visible on any file by going to their Properties inside the Asset Viewer Panel.

 

 

You can also manage and create your own custom fields. Use the dropdown **Fields** menu and choose **Manage fields** or **New +** to create your own field. 

 

The **Sorted By** option lets you choose one or multiple sort options based on your fields to see them displayed in that specific order. Select your field and sort them as A to Z.
​ 

This same level of organization and information with metadata can curate sets of saved searches we call Collections, which act as the building blocks you can use to craft the creative workflow that’s right for you and your team.
