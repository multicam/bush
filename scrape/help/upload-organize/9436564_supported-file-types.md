Frame.io will accept any file uploaded to your Project. File types that support viewers and reviewing features include all common video, image, audio, PDF and MS Office types. 

 

Below is a list of some of the popular file types we support across all media types that allow for playback/viewing in Frame.io. These file types have gone through validation testing to ensure playback/viewing works as expected. We are constantly running new file types through validation process. If the file type you&#x27;re looking for is not listed below, playback/viewing may still be supported, but it has not been officially validated yet. We are continually running validation tests and will keep this page updated accordingly.
