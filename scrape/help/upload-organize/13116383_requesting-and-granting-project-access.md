When you try to open something you don’t have permission to see, you may see a **Request Access** screen. 

You can send a request, and someone with the right permissions can approve or deny it. 

 

Access Requests can be triggered from: 

Projects (Public and Restricted) 

Assets 

Folders (Not restricted one) 

Public share links 

Collections 

In V4, all of these route to the **parent project**, but Frame.io still tracks the exact item (asset, folder, collection, etc.) that started the request. 

**How to request access** You may see the Request Access screen when: 

You open a link to a project, asset, folder, or public shares 

You try to open an item you used to have access to 

To request access: 

Click **Request Access** Submit 

What happens: 

The request goes to people who can grant access (for example: Admins, Owners, Content Admins, or others with **Can Invite permissions**) The request is logged at the **project** level You get a notification when it’s **approved** or **denied** 
**Who can approve** Who can approve depends on your plan and setup, but in general: 

People with **Can Invite** on the project Account Admins (Owners, Content Admins) 

For some enterprise setups, Adobe Admin Console admins may need to approve changes that affect seats 

Approvers see: 

Who requested access 

Which project and item it’s for 

Any seat or billing impact (for Frame‑managed plans) 

**Disabling access requests** 

Admins can turn off Access Requests when needed. 

**Account‑level settings:** In **Account Settings**, admins can disable all Access Requests for the account 
When Access Requests are disabled: 

The **Request access** option does not appear Users must contact an admin or project owner directly 

 

**FAQ** **Q: I clicked a folder, asset, or collection, but the request shows up at the project level. Why? ****A:** In V4, all supported items route access requests to the **parent project**. Frame.io still tracks the **exact item** (folder, asset, or collection) that triggered the request for context. This ensures requests go to the right people with permission to grant access 

**Q: I already have an account, but I still see “Request access.” What’s wrong? ****A:** You may be signed in with the **wrong email or account**. Check the email shown on the Request Access screen. Switch to the correct account, or submit a new request. 

**Q: Why don’t I see a Request Access prompt on some links? ****A:** Frame.io **does not currently support**: Restricted folders 

Separately secured shares 

If a link points to one of these, users with the link **won’t see a Request Access prompt** 
In those cases, access must be granted manually by a project admin.

 

Q: What happens when my request is approved? **A:** You’re added to the **project** (and, if needed, the specific item or share). Your role is set by the approver (often **Edit &amp; Share**). On Frame-managed plans, a **new seat may be created** if required.Related ArticlesFrame.io Transfer: Download and upload files, folders, and projects on your desktopUpload and download in Frame.io TransferWatch Frame.io with the Apple TV AppCreating Folders and Restricted FoldersAdobe Workfront Integration Overview
