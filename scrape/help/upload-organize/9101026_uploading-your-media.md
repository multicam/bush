Frame.io will accept any file uploaded to your Project. File types that support viewers and reviewing features include all common video, image, audio, PDF, and Microsoft Office file types. Files that do not have viewer support (examples: ZIP folders, certain project files) will still offer download and share options.
​
There are several ways you can begin uploading in the Frame.io web app.
​
You can upload your media by dragging and dropping the file or folder anywhere onto the project page.
​
Or, you can select **+ &gt; File upload **or **Folder upload** on the top right of your project. 

In both cases, if you choose to upload folders, Frame.io will retain the folder structure automatically!
​
No need to compress your media beforehand either. You can upload your largest files and we&#x27;ll make sure it plays back smoothly when it&#x27;s ready. Frame.io uses an accelerated file uploader, which allows for speeds up to 5 times faster than the top file-sharing services.
​
Frame.io encodes the files into HTML5 videos to play seamlessly on the web while still storing the original file available for download.
​
Once the upload is complete, hover scrubs are instantly created for videos and thumbnails for your still images. Non-media file types will be identified with a file icon.
​
​**Sort** your files in the order you wish to view them.
