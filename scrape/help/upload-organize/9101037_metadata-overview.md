*What&#x27;s new in V4: **Account-Wide Metadata**Field Management Tab*
**Metadata** acts as the flexible underlying structure that makes it easier than ever to organize and view your media assets based on how you and your team work. You can create an entirely customized view of your assets and what’s important to you by utilizing the Metadata features in your Project space. Now, Metadata that was previously logged outside of Frame.io can be captured and tracked with your work-in-progress media directly in the platform.
​
New workflows in Frame.io are now made possible with Metadata, such as organizing thousands of marketing deliverables by social media platform, and grouping them by asset type, duration, and release date, to assist marketing managers and ad operators in determining placement and release timing for each asset; or categorizing auditions by role, filtering for those rated 4 stars and above by the director. Mix and match all the fields to see what works best for you! 

 

## Appearance**Appearance** will give you different options on how you want the Project to visually look. Start by selecting either Grid or List view if you want a larger, visual view of your assets, or if you want a more compact info-detailed view of your assets. This can also be done by clicking the List or Grid icon to the right of the New Folder button on the right.
​
​**Layout** will have you switching between **List View** and **Grid View**. Use List View if you want to see a condensed view of all your assets (great if you have a large number of assets) and Grid View if you want a new visual view with thumbnails.
​
​**Card Size** will expand or shrink the view for larger or smaller thumbnails.
​
​**Aspect Ratio** will transform your asset card dimensions depending on the aspect size of the assets you’re using. The first option is for 16:9 widescreen assets, the second is for 1:1 square assets, and the third is for 9:16 vertical assets.
​
​**Thumbnail Scale** will make the thumbnail image fit to size if the Aspect Ratio is adjusted.
​
Options to toggle **Show Card Info** and **Flatten Folders** are also available, as well as the option to show longer titles if Show Card Info is selected.*Note:** Appearance options inside of a project will be personal by default. This means any changes made to your project appearance will be reflected only to you and not to any of your other project members.* 

## FieldsFields allow you to see the most important information about your assets directly on the asset card. This will make organizing and management of your files easier and more accurate. There are 33 out-of-the-box metadata fields to choose from.

It’s possible to also create a new custom field if there’s a field that isn’t displayed in our presets. To make a new custom field, click the **New Field** option and you’ll see 10 different field types to choose from.
​
Toggle the switch in the Fields dropdown to activate any Field on your assets within that Project.*Note: **This functionality is available to Admins and Full Access users by default, but can be adjusted by Admins in Account Settings to be Admins Only.* 

Custom fields can be applied account-wide, meaning that even if a field is created within or for a specific Project, it could be used in any Project or Workspace in the account it was created in as well. Full Access users only have the ability to **Add to All Projects **when creating a new Field. Admins have the ability to choose which individual Projects they would like to add the new field to. Choose the dropdown below your custom field options to choose the Project locations, then click **Save** to share that metadata field with those Projects. 

 

 

## SortThe Sort option lets you choose one or multiple sort options based on your fields to see them displayed in that specific order. Select your field and sort them as Ascending or Descending, First to Last, etc.

 

 

This same level of organization and information with metadata can curate sets of saved searches we call Collections, which act as the building blocks you can use to craft the creative workflow that’s right for you and your team. To read more about Collections, click here.&#x27;

 

## Account-Wide MetadataMetadata has the ability to travel with its asset across Projects and Workspaces account-wide. This will allow for **account-level custom metadata fields**, a powerful new capability designed to revolutionize how teams manage their workflows and data consistency across projects. 

 

This means that whenever an asset is **copied**, **moved**, or **duplicated**, the asset will keep all existing metadata as the original instead of needing to recreate the metadata fields on a new copy. A metadata field only needs to be created once and can be applied to any asset across an entire account instead of being recreated multiple times in different Workspaces and on different assets. 

## Fields Management TabCustom metadata fields are now stored in an account library, which can be found in the **Fields Management Tab** in your Account Settings. This can also be accessed from the **Fields **menu from the Project page and clicking **Manage Fields**. This tab is only visible to Admins. 

 

Highlighting a metadata field will show information about the field&#x27;s visibility, creator, date created, and which Projects it is currently available in. Click the three-dot menu next to **All Projects** to adjust the Project accessibility if you would like to choose specific Project locations rather than All Projects for that metadata field. 

The field can also **hide**, be **edited**, or be **deleted**. Hiding a field will temporarily remove the field from use until it is **shown** again. **Edit **the field to adjust its settings. **Delete **the field permanently if you would like from your account. 

Above the Field listings is an option for **Field Management Permission**, which states &quot;Admins and Full Access users can create, edit, and deleted fields.&quot; The option to the right will allow you to choose whether you want this to be for **Admins &amp; Full Access Users** or **Admins Only**. 

## FAQ**Q: Are there any known limitations in the web app regarding copying in the web app?****A: **There is a 200 asset limit on bulk operations, including move, copy, delete, and bulk metadata updating.
