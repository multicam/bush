**Creating Folders**Give your account some structure by creating Folders and sub-folders. 
​
There are three ways to create a new folder. Click the **+** button on the top right of your Project PageRight-click in the project space and choose New Folder

Select the **+ **icon next to Assets in the project navigation
Name a new folder when you create it and click **OK**. 

 

## Adding Assets to FoldersSelect and drag a file on the folder to drop it in the next folder level. Select multiple files by holding the Shift key &amp; Command/Control while clicking the files. To move any files out of that folder level or moved elsewhere in your account, utilize the **Move To** option or click and drag the assets to the destination folder in the project navigation.
​
Frame.io supports nested folders, so you can create as many sub-folders as you need to keep your projects organized!
​## Navigating Through FoldersTo view your project&#x27;s folder structure, the folder tree structure can be accessed on the left-hand panel.

​*Note:** At this time, the folder tree in the project navigation panel is currently sorted by asset_id and **not by** name, date created. If you apply a sort on the project, order of folders will not match between project nav and folder. * 

For easy structural integrity, simply upload a Folder from your desktop and Frame.io will retain its structure!
​**Restricted Folders**Restricted Folders in Frame.io V4 are secure folders created within your Projects that are accessible only to explicitly invited Project Members, allowing for greater privacy, granular member control, and tighter security on the folders and assets you manage. This feature is exclusive to Frame.io V4. 

 

 

To create a Restricted Folder, click the “+” icon in the Project page, or just right click inside your project, and select **New Restricted Folder**. The lock Icon will appear in the bottom-left of the folder to visually identify that it is a Restricted Folder to those who can see it. Only Owners, Admins, and users with Full Access permissions can create a Restricted Folder. 

 

You can also turn any folder into a Restricted Folder by opening its folder settings and sliding the **Make Restricted** toggle on. A warning will appear letting you know that only people who have been directly invited to the folder plus admins will have access, and that any assets in this folder that were previously added to Shares will be removed. 

 

A Restricted Folder will not be visible in the Project if a member does not have the proper permissions to access it. Right-click on a Restricted Folder to open **Manage Access** and manage the permissions of who can access any Restricted Folder within a Project. By default, every Admin and Owner in a Project will have access to every Restricted Folder and cannot have their access taken away unless their role in the account is changed. 

 

To invite a new Member to a Restricted Folder, select the **Add **option at the top-right to drop down a list of all Project members available to add. Select the member, choose their restricted folder-level permission, and click **Add** in the bottom-right. 
​ 

Members may have their permissions adjusted just for that restricted folder for more granular permissions control. 

 

If needed, by toggling off **Make Restricted**, access will return to all members of the Project. 

### Sharing Restricted Folders/AssetsRestricted folders and the assets inside it can be safely shared for review in a Share
Link without needing to remove any secure restrictions off of the folder. 

When selecting the restricted folder to share from the three-dot menu, you will be given a message notifying you that there will be restricted content in your Share Link.
The same message will appear if you try and share an asset within a restricted folder. Only a single restricted folder level can be shared at a time. Any sub-folders inside of a restricted folder will not be shared in a Share Link. 

*Note:** If at any point a folder or asset becomes restricted while it is actively being shared, it will be immediately removed from any existing Share Link it is apart of. If a folder or asset is changed to public from restricted, previously shared items will remain in the Share Link.*

**FAQ** **Q: How will this affect access to folders in Collections?** 
​**A: **Assets within Restricted Folders are not visible within Collections. This is because Collections do not have invite level access like a Restricted Folder does, so for privacy reasons all assets are protected. 
​ 
​**Q: Will Restricted Folders affect my total Storage?** 
​**A: **Yes, even if a Restricted Folder seems hidden to some users, it’s assets will still take up the same amount of space in your overall storage space on your account.
