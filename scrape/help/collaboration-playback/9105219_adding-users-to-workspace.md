**Watch the Adding User tutorial**### Adding a UserAdding a user to your Workspace will grant them inherited access to all existing and future Projects within the Workspace.

To add a user to your Workspace, click on the purple People icon in the top right hand corner of your Workspace page. Add the email of the user you wish to invite and add a custom message if desired. 
​ 

The role options are:
​
​Content Admin**​**A Content Admin will have full permissions across your Workspace, Projects, and Account Settings including managing users, controlling billing, and much more. 
​
​**Member**
A Member will have access to all projects on the workspace as well as general access to basic account information and their own personal settings. 
​
There is also the **Owner** user in Frame.io. While not a selectable user type, they are highest level user in a Workspace. They will have full access over the entire Workspace and are the only user who can manage their plan. There can only be one Owner per account.*Note:** A new user added to your workspace will be added as a **Member **to your account**.** You can change the role of a member to a **Content Admin**. To change roles, go to Settings and Users. Select your user and select Content Admin from the role drop down menu.* 

 

When users are added to your Workspace, they **automatically** get added to your existing Projects **as well as any new Projects you create**. Users can be added to the Workspace from the homepage. Click on the purple People icon, and add their name or email to your Workspace.
​### Removing a UserTo remove a user from your Workspace, click on the purple People icon in the top right hand corner. Scroll to **Manage** and **Remove access** next to the user name. *Note: Removing a user from your Workspace does not remove them from the account!*​In order to remove a user from the account go to your Users page in your account settings, click on your user and select **Remove user**. Select **Delete** to remove the user from your account. 

 

### Bulk ActionBoth adding and removing users to a Workspace can be done in bulk action as well. In your Account Settings under the Users tab, click on multiple users and select the **Add to resource **action button on the bottom-right. 

 

Users can be added to any Workspaces that are available, as well as any individual Projects within a Workspace. If they are added to a Workspace, they will inherit access to all Projects within that Workspace when added in. Select their preferred permission level and click **Add** to complete the move. 

 

**Note:** Only Account Members can be added to Workspaces and Projects. If you attempt to add a Non-account Members, such as Reviewer or Guests, to a Workspace or Project, a prompt will appear to change these Users as proper Members on your account, incurring a charge per User based on your plan.
