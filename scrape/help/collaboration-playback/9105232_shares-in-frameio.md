**Watch the Shares tutorial****Shares** are how you create external links to send media to collaborators, clients, producers, stakeholders, and more for review. Let’s imagine that you’ve just finished creating some assets and now you’re ready to share your work. With Frame.io, you can simply select your media and click the Share icon to generate a new share link fast, complete with full customization for branding options like logo, description, and background image to privacy settings like passphrase, expiration date, and permissions. 
​## How to create a ShareThe Shares section is located just below Collections in your Project Navigation Panel. To create a new Share link, click the + icon next to Shares. This will generate an empty Share page for you to begin populating your media. You must have the user permission to share activated before you can share. 

​*Note: **Sharing a folder with sub-folders will share all media within while retaining the folder structure. Files added or removed in a shared folder will dynamically update the Share link making it easy to update the client&#x27;s view of content without sharing multiple external links.*You can also click on any file or folder’s three-dot menu to create a new Share, or add that file or folder to an existing Share link if you have any already created. After selecting any asset, the Share icon in the bottom right will allow you to create a new share link. Select as many assets as you want from multiple locations to be included in the share. You can also right-click any single asset to bring up the media options and then select Share &gt; Create new Share. 

 

 

## Share Links Filter 

Your share links can be sorted and filtered by clicking on the three-dot menu in the Share Links section. Standard sort options are listed under **Sort By**, with the option to **Order By **just below. The **Filter By** options allow you to show **All Shares **or only the share links that were **Created By You**. This option will only show the links that were you authored and hides the rest, making it easier to find and manage your own share links. 

## Custom SortWhen you create a new Share, Custom is always the default sort option. With Custom sort, you can drag and drop your assets and folders into any order you want inside of your Share link. 

 

For any assets that are already added into your Share link and with Custom sort turned on, drag a single asset drop it between the line to indicate where you want the asset to be place in between. Click the check boxes in the top-left of the asset to select multiple assets to for a multi-move option. 

 

 

For assets that are not in your Share link or you want to start a new one, by using the check boxes, you can select the order in which the assets appear in your Share link. Then select Share &gt; Create new Share or click the **Share** icon in the bottom-right and the assets will appear in your desired order. *Note: **Assets can only be custom sorted on the root level of a Share. Assets inside folders in a Share cannot be custom sorted.*In both cases, make sure you are in the Grid or List views to be able to custom sort your assets. Currently, you cannot reorder assets while in the Reel view, but you can use the Reel view after sorting if needed.

 

## Share Settings 

Whether you have an empty Share page or already have your media populated, there’s still a lot to look over for customization and settings before you send out your Share link. 
​
Share Settings can be found in the far right section of this page where page layout, security, permissions, and more can be configured. 
​
​**Share Visibility** is where you can grab the short URL for the share link you created and send it out immediately. The toggle will allow you to disable the sending and viewing of the share link if you wish to delay or remove access. 

**Share Link Via Email** is how you can send the same share link directly to someone&#x27;s email address. If a user you&#x27;re sending it to is in your account, you can select them here, or you can send it so someone from outside of your workspace as well. An email will be sent by Frame.io directly to anyone you add here with the same share URL created in your share settings. 

 

You can also select between **Public **and **Secure **sharing, allowing for either visible to anyone or making it only visible to other project members in your Project and people you add to the Share link (exclusive to Enterprise customers). 

**Recent Share Activity **is where you can view your Share Link Activity, a notification feed that indicates the most recent engagement from your Reviewers coming from this Share link. Clicking on **View **opens the full feed and will show all user names, dates, and actions chronologically to when they occurred. The trackable actions are **Opened Share Link**,** Viewed Asset**,** Commented**,** **and** Download. ** 

​**Layout **allows you to choose from Grid or Reel formats. Grid will provide a view of all your media with all their own independent viewers to scroll through, while Reel is a single player page that lets you change out media from left to right. 

*Note:** If you only have one asset to share, select the **Open in Viewer** toggle to bypass the Share link landing page. * 

​**Security** allows you to enable a Passphrase for the viewer to have to input before opening the Share link and viewing its contents, and the Expiration date puts in place a date and time the link will be viewable before their access is removed.
​
​**Permissions** simply allow the viewer to be able to comment or download the assets with an easy toggle switch. Show all versions allows a user to view all versions in any share version stacked media, or just the latest asset in a version stack if toggled off. Display transcriptions and captions if available as well.
​
The **Featured field** is how you can choose the default field to be edited by Share recipients. The updates made to the field here will be shown on assets in the Project
​## Share Custom Branding 

Create visual themes and set media organization with our Share customization options.
​
The **+ **button at the top will allow you to add in an** icon **to your Share page. Choose from a selection of emojis or an image from your desktop. Click **upload image** to add a header to your Share page with an image from your desktop. The icon will become a pencil 
​
The **Header** button offers Header size and display options to show or hide, as well as custom background uploads.
​
Add a description below the creator&#x27;s name for additional reference text.
​
Adjust the Appearance for options such as light or dark mode, accent colors, and how you want the media thumbnails to look. Fields and Sort options are also similar to your Project organization experience and will save the settings for your Share recipients. 

Looking to save a custom branded template for all shares instead of having to set the same one up each time you want to share? Head on over to your [Branding settings](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/10606574-branding-settings) in your Account Settings to set this up.
​## All SharesAll Shares will always display at the top of the individual shares you create. This is where you can collect and keep track of all shares made in your workspace. Any share link can be managed and adjusted from this page, even if the link is already in the hands of a client. Shares can be also duplicated as well for easy template creation.
​
Share URLs can be quickly copied from here to share with others. Visibility can be turned on or off to allow access to the link or to block access. Last Viewed and View counter will give updated info on how active your link is. The option to edit link options can be found by right-clicking on the share link listing.
​**Viewing a Share Link**Opening a Share link will look identical to how you have it set up for anyone who receives the link. Once the user opens a media file, they can interact with the media, reply directly to comments, or leave some of their own. After their first comment is left, they will be asked to enter their name and email address for identification and to receive email notification updates.

*Note:** ​This information will only be saved for the session they are in and will have to enter their credentials next time they access the link.*Email notifications will be sent out to reviewers when:

Invited to a new share link

Comment created* 

Reply created*

@ mentioned created*

 * only in the assets that they’ve comment on within the share link

 

## Legacy SharesIf you&#x27;ve updated from Frame.io Legacy (V3) to V4, all your previous Review and Presentation links will be migrated as well, and any comments made on assets in those links will be reflected in the assets in V4. Once updated, you will be able to access Review and Presentation links, as well as delete or disable the links. In order to view Legacy Review and Presentation links, users can go to the All Shares table and select the dropdown at the top of the page.
​You will **not** have the ability to have edits made to your Legacy review and presentation links, though if you duplicate any Legacy links, they will immediately become V4 shares. This will create a new V4 share with all the assets that were in the review or presentation link.
