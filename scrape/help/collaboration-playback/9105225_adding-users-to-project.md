**Watch the Adding User tutorial**### Adding users in a ProjectAdding a user to a Project grants them access to all Folders, Assets, Shares and public collections within the Project. Users will not have access to other Projects in the Workspace unless explicitly invited. An account member can be invited to as many Projects as needed, but Guests are limited to a single Project at a time.
​
To add users to a Project, you can click the purple User button while in the project page 

 

Enter the email of the user you want to invite and select **Add.** 

 

**Remove users from a Project**To remove users from a Project, you can click the purple User button while in the project page and select Manage.

 

 

Use the drop down menu next to the user you wish to remove and select Remove Access. 

*Note: Removing a user from your Project does not remove them from the account! *In order to remove a user from the account go to your Users page in your account settings, click on your user and select **Remove user**. Select **Delete** to remove the user from your account. 

 

## Bulk ActionBoth adding and removing users to a Project can be done in bulk action as well. In your Account Settings under the Users tab, click on multiple users and select the **Add to resource **action button on the bottom-right. 

 

Users can be added to any Workspaces that are available, as well as any individual Projects within a Workspace. If they are added to a Workspace, they will inherit access to all Projects within that Workspace when added in. Select their preferred permission level and click **Add** to complete the move. 

 

**Note:** Only Account Members can be added to Workspaces and Projects. If you attempt to add a Non-account Members, such as Reviewer or Guests, to a Workspace or Project, a prompt will appear to change these Users as proper Members on your account, incurring a charge per User based on your plan. 

## Guest SeatsGuest seats are a new license type that is free of charge, but limits users access to only a single project at a time. These users can only manipulate their own personal profiles (name/email, etc.) or view the usage of the account overall. They do not inherit content access by being added to the account. 

 

Accounts on Pro plan tiers have a hard limit of 3 Guest seats and Free plan includes 1 Guest. Guests are not available on Enterprise plans. 

 

Consult the [Usage page](https://next.frame.io/settings/usage) to see how many Guest seats are available on your plan.**Note:** Guest Users are only available on select Free and Pro plans. Contact our Support team to see if your account qualifies for Guest user access.
