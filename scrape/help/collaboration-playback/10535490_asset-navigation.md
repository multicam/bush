Looking to move between your assets in the viewer quickly and without needing to back out to the full group of assets you&#x27;re working with to select the next one? Make sure to utilize our **Asset Navigation** shortcut by using the `←` and `→` or the `[` and `]` keys while in the viewer. Use this within your Projects, in a Collection, or in a Share Link to make, viewing, sorting through, and approving hundreds of assets to be a much faster process. 

Additionally, click on the previous/next controls at the top-right of the player to manually click through all assets in your project.

 

### Video Navigation and ScrubbingAsset Navigation adjusts slightly when viewing a video asset in Frame.io. The `←` and `→` keys will now advance the video one frame in either direction, while `shift + ←` and `shift + →` will advance the video 10 frames in either direction. The `[` and `]` keys will still navigate to the previous and next videos as normal.Related ArticlesUploading your mediaShare links explained for clientsKeyboard shortcutsCommenting and the Player page on the iOS appComparison Viewer
