Transcription in Frame.io lets you generate an automated transcript from spoken dialogue in video and audio files for easy navigation during playback, searching for key moments within seconds, exporting transcript files in an instant, and much more. Now reviewing and approving your dialogue, podcasts, and audiobooks can be streamlined more efficiently in Frame.io. 

 

## Using Transcription To create a transcript for an audio or video file, first click on the **Transcription icon** in the bottom-right of the playbar and a new panel will appear on the left. 

 

Select one of 27 supported languages (see the full list of languages below) to transcribe into that will match the audio/video file and click **Transcribe **and begin to generate**. **You can also select the **Auto** option to auto-detect the supported language. The transcription generating time will usually only take a few minutes to complete before it is complete. 

*Note:** The Transcription feature does not offer translation services, so it is only recommended to select the language that matches your audio/video file.* When the transcript becomes available, you will see the text broken down individually by speaker with Speaker ID during playback, the text in the transcript will be highlighted and sync with the video/audio playback. The transcription will also auto-scroll during playback to help follow along while watching the video. 

 

 

*Note: **You will receive notifications when transcriptions are finished generating, but only for transcripts you generate. Notifications can be managed in your [Account Settings](https://next.frame.io/settings/notifications).*
​You can navigate through your audio/video file using the transcript by clicking on any word, and it will bring you to that exact timeline of your playback. This means that if you want to leave a comment on the exact timecode of a word in the transcript, clicking on that word and then creating a comment will link those timecodes together. Additionally, highlighting a phrase in the transcript will allow you to create a range-based comment by clicking on the “+” icon that appears. 

 

 

Use the search bar above the transcript to find exactly what word or phrase you’re looking for throughout the transcription instantly. All examples will be highlighted, and you can click arrow up and arrow down as shortcuts to scroll through the multiple results. 

 

 

## Using CaptionsOnce transcription is enabled, you will have the ability to toggle closed captions as well. Click on the “CC” icon next to the Transcription icon to enable this feature. Both captions and transcript will be in sync with your audio/video file during playback. Closed captions will also be available on iOS. 

 

 

### Caption IngestTranscriptions and captions are auto-generated with Frame.io when using this feature. If you would rather use your own captions using SRT or VTT files, you can choose to upload those directly into the video asset as well. From the CC icon, select **Add Captions **and click on **Upload Captions**. You can also find this option in the three-dot menu in the Transcriptions panel or in the Project page in the asset three-dot menu. 

 

Choose the SRT or VTT file to load into the uploader and choose the correct language that is associated with the captions. Once everything is queued up and ready to go, click **Add to Asset** to begin uploading the caption file. 

 

When the file is finished uploading, you can toggle turning on and off the synced captions on your video asset. You can now also choose to view the Transcript panel in the transcript or captions format. 

 

*Note:** It&#x27;s possible to see multiple captions listed under the same language in the Captions menu. To tell the difference, highlight the language listing to see what the source of the caption is; whether it is a Frame-generated caption or a caption ingest.* 

## Editing Transcriptions and CaptionsIn the event that any of the transcriptions are inaccurate or needs to be adjusted, you can easily edit and make changes to them, and have those edits synced to the associated captions.

 

Go to the three-dot menu and select **Edit **for either Transcriptions or Captions** **to put you into Edit mode. You can also highlight a group of text and click on the Pencil icon or double click on any text to enter into Edit mode. Once your edits are made, click **Save**, or click **Cancel** to discard your latest edits. Finally, refresh the page to see the edits reflected in the captions of the video and have everything properly synced up again. 

## Label SpeakersTranscriptions will be able to identify the individual speakers in your media and separate their voices, with Speaker 1, Speaker 2, and so on as the label. This allows you to watch and follow your Transcriptions flow more naturally and conversationally, especially if there are multiple people talking in your media. 

 

 

This is an optional feature and can be either checked or unchecked just before the transcription process begins.

This feature also asks for explicit consent anytime you want to use it because Speaker ID. If you wish to bypass this and accept consent for all future transcripts, check the box off and click **I Agree** the next time you see this disclaimer.*Note: Due to stricter laws, US users in Texas &amp; Illinois are not able to use the Label Speaker feature.*
