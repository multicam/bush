*What&#x27;s new in V4: **Compare any two assets regardless of file type**When comparing static assets, **Link** controls to zoom on both assets simultaneously or **Unlink** to zoom and reposition assets independently* 
The **Comparison Viewer **in Frame.io V4 is the best way to compare all your assets side-by-side and make it easier to see the differences between edits. This view comes with the ability to leave comments on either asset and compare details with linked zoom and playback controls. This view supports all video, image, audio, PDF, and MS Office types. 

Select two assets in your Project, click the three-dot menu and then select **Compare Assets **to launch into the Comparison view. If you want to compare two version stacked assets, select the option to **Compare Versions** in the Project page or in the player page of the version stacked assets. You can also select a single asset and a version stacked asset and choose which of these two options to compare. You can also do this by selecting the **Compare icon** at the bottom bar of your Project page. 

*Note: **You can compare any two assets in Frame.io. They do not have to be the same file type to use the Comparison Viewer.* 

Comments can be made while in the Comparison view. Click on the left or right asset header you wish to leave feedback on to ensure the feedback is being left on the correct asset.

 

When comparing assets that are static (non-video), there will be an option to **Unlink controls **on the top of the viewer as a link icon. When linked, you will be able to control both assets with any zoom and repositioning actions made. If unlinked, the two assets will act independently, allowing you to select the asset you want to move around while the other will stay untouched. 

 

Clicking the &quot;**x**&quot; icon on either asset will resume single-asset viewing in your player page.Related ArticlesFrame.io V4 / Legacy Feature ComparisonMicrosoft Office Support for Frame.ioWhat to expect when updating to V4: A comprehensive guide for Enterprise customersWhat to expect when updating to V4: A comprehensive guide for updating your account on a Free, Pro, or Team PlanAdobe Premiere Frame.io V4 Panel Overview (25.6 and later)
