**Text Markups** offer a more dynamic and richer viewing and commenting experience for your documents in Frame.io V4 than ever before. Interact directly within your PDFs and MS Office files by highlighting text, adding comments with proper visual context, and searching through your document in an instant. This feature is available on both the web app and iOS. **Note:** Text Markups will only work on uploads after September 2024. Any previously uploaded document or MS Office files will need to be re-uploaded in order to utilize this feature. 

Begin by opening your document in Frame.io and highlighting any text directly onto it. Doing so will show a pop-up button to **Suggest Edit. **Selecting this will enable **Suggestions** on your document. You can also enable this on your own by selecting the same “T” icon on the player bar next to the Settings cog. 

 

With Suggestions enabled, your highlighted text can be the center of your next comment with four different options for how you want to present it with additional feedback: 

**Highlight**: A simple highlight of the word or phrase to go with your feedback. The text will be highlighted in yellow on the document. 
**Insert**: Suggest something to be added alongside the word or phrase. The text will be accompanied by a &quot;green lollipop&quot; marker on the document.
**Delete**: Suggest removing this word or phrase. The text will be struck through and be highlighted in red on the document. 
**Replace**: Suggest a replacement for this word or phrase. The text will be struck through and be highlighted in orange on the document. 
 

 

Similar to annotated comments, selecting any comment card on the right will highlight the associated text inside the document. Additionally, the feature to show all Suggested Edits all at once can be toggled on by going to the Settings cog &gt; View on Asset &gt; Suggested Edits. 

 

 

Use **CMD/Ctrl + F** to trigger in-document search when you’re looking for an exact word or phrase within your document. You can use the up and down arrows as shortcuts or hit **ENTER** to navigate through search results. 

## FAQ **Q: If the document is Watermark enabled, will Text Markups still be available?** 
​**A: **No. If Watermark (Session-based or Static) is enabled, the document upload will resort to an image proxy document that cannot be interacted with. This means that users will not be able to highlight text, search in documents, or add suggestion comments, though it’s important to note that **any suggestion comments previously left will still be visible**. If watermarking is ever disabled, the document will regain all Text Markup functionality (highlight text, search in document, add suggestion comments). 
​**Q: Will my Text Markups show in Comment exports and Print comments?** 
​**A: **Yes. These new suggestion comments will appear in Print comments and other comment export formats. Related ArticlesMicrosoft Office Support for Frame.ioEnhanced search with media intelligenceMultipage PDF viewerE-Learning for Enterprise CustomersFrame.io Transcription Overview
