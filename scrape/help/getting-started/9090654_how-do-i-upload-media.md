Frame.io is the single source to store all of your project’s files while simplifying sharing and collecting feedback. There are multiple ways to upload files into your account.
​## Web AppThrough the web app, simply **drag and drop** files and folders into any project space to initiate the media upload. Entire folder structures can even be dragged into Frame.io. Additionally, select the “**+**” icon in the upper right of the asset grid to pull up a menu and select your media. 

 

The media will begin uploading and the progress will be visible by clicking on the Uploads cloud icon. This will bring up the **Upload Sheet** which allows you to pause, resume, and cancel uploads all in a centralized location. Notice those lightning-fast uploads. 

 

## Frame.io iOS AppDoes your media live on your iPhone or iPad? It’s easy to start uploading with the [Frame.io iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frame-io/id1056295002?ls=1). No need to export media to your desktop first; just open the app, tap **Upload** inside a Project, and immediately see the media populate inside the web app for everyone to access.
