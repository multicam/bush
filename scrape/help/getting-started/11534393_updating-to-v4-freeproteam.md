## Workspaces and Projects 

A new term to learn in Frame.io V4 is **[Workspaces](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/9101001-workspace-overview)**, or what was once known as Teams in Legacy Frame. 

All the Teams and Projects that you had access to in Legacy will be accessible via the new Workspace homepage. Private Projects (called [Restricted Projects](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/9101001-workspace-overview#h_18e9d2d23e) in V4) will retain their privacy and, upon updating, all Members must be invited back to them to gain access. 

## Share links**Share links** is the new terminology in V4 for Review and Presentation links. 

All Review and Presentation links will be migrated to V4, and any comments made on assets in those links will be reflected in the assets in V4. Users will still be able to access their Review and Presentation links, as well as delete or disable the links. See below steps for an overview of how to access the links.

 

 

Click into **All Share Links **in the bottom-left Share tab and at the top-center of your Project page, there will be a dropdown listed as **All Shares** which will contain all the migrated Legacy Review and Presentation links. 

*Note:** These Legacy Shares will not be configurable within V4. However, you can go to the link&#x27;s three-dot menu and select** Duplicate as V4 Share** to modify the new Shares. This will create a new V4 share (with a new URL) using all the assets that were in the Review or Presentation link.* 

## Commenting 

For Team plans with Legacy Team Only Comments, those comments (now known as **Internal Comments**) will be hidden by default when updating to the latest version of Frame.io. 

If an Owner or Admin would like to restore these comments, they can simply reach our to our Support team who will be able to restore Legacy Team Only Comments to become V4 Internal Comments, allowing all members of the Project/Workspace to view/access.
