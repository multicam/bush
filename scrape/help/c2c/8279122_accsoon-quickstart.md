*Specific to V3 accounts:**Ensure C2C Connections are enabled in your project settings**Ensure you have C2C Device management permissions within the account the project is hosted in*
 

**Note: only the SeeMo Pro and CineView Master 4K supports SDI video* 

# SetupRefer to your device&#x27;s instructions on powering up and connecting your HDMI or SDI camera.

Connect your iOS device to your Accsoon device and launch the Accsoon SEE app.*

Tap the Frame.io logo on the screen to open the Frame.io menu.

In the Frame.io menu, tap “Login”. 

Enter your account credentials then click “Allow” when prompted by the app to grant upload permissions for Frame.io.

Once logged in, select which Frame.io account you would like to work in, followed by which project within the selected account you would like to upload assets to.

In the Frame.io menu, set RECORD UPLOAD to ON and choose your desired setting for UPLOAD MODE and CELLULAR DATA UPLOADING. The REAL-TIME option for UPLOAD MODE will upload your recordings to Frame.io while they&#x27;re being recorded.

Tap the settings icon in the lower right corner of the screen to open the encoder settings. Adjust these to match your workflow. For uploading over cellular connections, we recommend a bitrate between 3 and 5Mbps.

**Note: if you are connecting to your CineView Master 4K over WiFi, Frame.io uploads will only be available over your iOS device&#x27;s cellular connection* 

# Troubleshooting**Where do I find the recordings on my device?**Recordings from the Accsoon SEE app will appear in your device&#x27;s camera roll.

 

## Where do I see my upload progress?If REAL-TIME is selected for UPLOAD MODE, you will see a queue number and progress bar around the Frame.io logo on the screen. You can also tap the Frame.io logo and go to the UPLOAD tab of the Frame.io window to see more information about the current uploads.

 

## My files aren&#x27;t uploading from my CineView Master 4KThe CineView Master 4K offers the ability to connect your iOS device via lightning or USB (just like on the SeeMo devices) or via WiFi. If you are connecting to your CineView Master 4K via WiFi, uploads will only be available using your iOS device&#x27;s cellular connection. Therefore, if you are using WiFi to connect to your CineView Master 4K, an active cellular connection is required to upload.
