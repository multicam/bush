# Starting a new project*In Workfront:** *Click the **New **button under **My Projects **and select **Blank Project** to create a new project. All new Workfront projects will create a corresponding project in Frame.io. Once the new project is created, make sure to give it a proper name in Workfront. The new project name will automatically be retitled in Frame.io as well. *In Frame.io:** *The new project you created in Workfront will appear as soon as it is created. 

There will be a &quot;Link&quot; icon in the top-right of the project thumbnail indicating that it is a project that is **Linked to Workfront**. Additionally, you can now open **Project Settings** and select **Open in Workfront** to open the Workfront project directly from Frame.io. 

 

# Uploading media*In Workfront:** *Select **Documents **from the menu bar on the left. This is where your media is collected in Workfront and how it will be shared to your Frame.io project. Click on **Add new** and select **Document **or **Drag &amp; Drop **your documents in the black bar in the Project Folders space to begin uploading your files into Workfront. *Note: **Workfront is unable to upload folders and nested folder structures at this time. You can create new folders in Workfront by clicking **Add new &gt; Folders **and upload new assets in them to recreate your folder structures. You can also still use Frame.io to upload your folder structures and they will appear in Workfront synched identically.* *In Frame.io:** *Anything [uploaded into your Frame.io project](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/9090654-getting-started-how-do-i-upload-media) will be accessible in the linked Workfront project and vice versa. Additionally, for any time you edit or move a asset/folder/version stack on Frame.io, this change will be reflected automatically in Workfront. 

## Viewing assets*In Workfront:** *By clicking on **Document Details** in Workfront, you can open up a preview of the asset you uploaded and review its information as well as download the asset if needed. You can edit the description of the asset by clicking the **&quot;pencil&quot; icon** on the top-right of the page. You can also update the asset by uploading a new version by clicking the **New Version **button on the top-left of the page. 

If you want to view the asset in Frame.io from Workfront, you can click the **Open in Frame.io** button next to the &quot;pencil&quot; edit icon. This will open you directly to the viewer page of the asset in Frame.io to begin making comments. You need to have a Frame.io license to open the asset in the Frame.io project. 

# Stakeholder approval*In Workfront:** *Once your asset is ready for stakeholder review and approval, you can request **approval** in Workfront. 

Open any asset and from the preview page click on the **Approval** tab. This will open a Request approval page for you to add your approvers and/or reviewers to the asset and turn on additional settings. 

**Approval Templates**: Add an **Approval Template** to choose which template group you&#x27;d like to apply to this approval. Otherwise, you can manually add in your approvers below. To learn more about approval templates, click [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront/using/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/manage-asset-review-and-approval/create-approval-template). 
**Due On: **Set a due date if there is a necessary deadline for the asset to be approved or reviewed by. Apply the calendar date under **Due on** to set when the link will expire for anyone who will be given access to the share link. 
Finally, add approvers and/or reviewers to your asset. 

**Approver**: The recipient will be notified by email and via their requests dashboard widget in Workfront. When opening the review, approvers will have the ability to comment and make an approval decision (approved or needs work). 
**Reviewer**: The recipient will be notified by email and via their requests dashboard widget in Workfront. When opening the review, reviewers will have the ability to comment but cannot make an approval decision. 
Once your users are added, click **Submit Request** to notify approvers and/or reviewers. 

You now will see the **Open in Frame.io** button change to **Open review**. This will direct you to the asset review experience for you to see the stakeholder feedback.
​
​Approvers can make their decision from within Workfront or from the review within Frame.io. Approval decisions are synced across both platforms. 
​ Reviewers can mark their review completed from within Workfront to let their team know they&#x27;re done with their review and keep their requests organized.
​*In Frame.io:** *Approvers will see the option to make an approval decision in the Frame.io viewer. The options for approval will be to select **Approved**, **Needs Work**, or to leave **No response**.** ** 

 

Stakeholder&#x27;s decisions are synced to Workfront and the overall status is updated. To learn more about Workfront approvals, click [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront/using/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/document-approval-status). 

The **&quot;People&quot;** icon with the number next to it indicates how many people are asked to approve the asset. View the collective user statuses of all invitees and approvals by clicking on that icon. 

# User management*In Workfront: *If you&#x27;re looking to share your Frame.io project with additional users from Workfront, starting at the project page in Workfront, click on the **Share **button. 

 

You can grant access to individual users or Workfront groups as a way to grant multiple users access in a single listing. To learn more about Workfront groups, click [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront/using/administration-and-setup/manage-groups/groups/groups). 
​ Select the user or group you wish to add to the project, manage their access level, and click **Save**. 

*In Frame.io:** *When viewing your project users in Frame.io, if a Workfront group was added, you will now see them listed as &quot;**Workfront Group**&quot; followed by the name of the group and all individual members listed below. They will function the same way [access groups](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/10966551-create-and-manage-access-groups) do in Frame.io and will all work under the same user permission assigned to the group. 

 

## User permissionsAs part of the integration, user permissions are controlled in Workfront and flow down to Frame.io. This means you cannot invite a user to a project in Frame.io or modify user permissions in Frame.io. These actions need to be done via the Project Share modal in Workfront. 

 

Permissions are mapped as follows: 

**Workfront user permission****Frame.io user permission**Manage

# FAQ**Q: What are the Frame.io requirements for using this integration?** **A:** In addition to having a Workfront license, you will need 1) Your Frame.io account to be V4 and Adobe managed (admin console) and 2) You must have a Frame.io Enterprise agreement in order to leverage Frame.io beyond Workfront stakeholder approval (i.e., access to Frame.io projects, asset management and all other Frame.io features), as well as your end users must have Frame.io licenses. 

**Q: What is Adobe enterprise storage?** **A: **Adobe enterprise storage is a cloud-based storage solution that serves as the central repository for assets across Adobe enterprise products. The Frame.io/Workfront integration is built on Adobe enterprise storage, enabling seamless collaboration and asset management between these platforms. 

To learn more about Adobe enterprise storage, click [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront/using/review-and-approve-work/document-reviews-and-approvals/esm-overview). 

**Q: Are there any Frame.io to Workfront limitations currently with this integration?** **A: **At this time, comments from Frame.io do not sync into Workfront, and vice versa. 

**Q: Are there any naming requirements for projects, assets, or folders?** **A:** Workfront projects must have unique names. Files and folders within a Workfront project must also have unique names. 

**Q: What is the difference between the &quot;Approval Status&quot; and &quot;Status&quot; fields in Frame.io?** **A:** The Approval Status field is used exclusively for the Workfront integration. Status is a separate field that can be used to track an asset&#x27;s status within Frame.io. 

**Q: Do Frame.io content security settings apply to assets in Workfront projects?** **A: **Content security settings applied to assets in Shares will function for Workfront approvals. However, any settings applied to assets will not protect assets stored in Workfront linked projects as those assets are surfaced outside of Frame.io (i.e. in Workfront) and Frame.io&#x27;s content security settings cannot be applied. 

**Q: Do asset lifecycle settings work with the integration** 
​**A: **Yes, asset lifecycle settings can be applied for assets in Workfront linked Projects. Given assets are unified across Workfront and Frame.io, assets will be deleted across both products. Reminder that in Workfront, approval data is not available for deleted assets.
