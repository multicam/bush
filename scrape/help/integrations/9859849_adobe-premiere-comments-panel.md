# How to Access and Use the Frame.io Comments Panel in Premiere ProFrame.io integrates seamlessly with Adobe Premiere Pro, enabling users to review, comment, and collaborate directly within their video editing workflow. This guide outlines the steps to access and use the Frame.io Comments Panel, with compatibility details for different Premiere Pro versions.

 

The newly redesigned **Frame.io Comments panel **in Premiere Pro works exclusively with Frame.io Version 4 accounts and is the perfect tool for sharing cuts and managing feedback from others inside of your Premiere project. 

The panel is aware of which sequence you have open in the timeline, and will show you comments associated with your edit without any navigation in Frame.io required. Uploading a new version of an edit is now a one-button experience. 

 

**Where to find it** For Premiere Pro 25.2 and later, the Frame.io Comments Panel will be native inside of Premiere Pro under `Window &gt; Frame.io &gt; Frame.io V4 Comments`. It can also be accessed in the updated &quot;Review&quot; workspace. Navigate to `Window &gt; Workspaces &gt; Reset to Saved Layout` to see the update if you&#x27;ve used the &quot;Review&quot; workspace with the legacy Frame.io panel.For older versions, navigate to **Window &gt; Extensions &gt; Comments** to access the Frame.io panel. Ensure the extension is installed from the [Adobe Exchange Marketplace](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/202297) if it doesn’t appear. 

 

To access Frame.io within Premiere Pro, ensure the extension is installed. Download it from the [Adobe Exchange Marketplace](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/202297) and restart Premiere Pro after installation to complete the setup. 

For Premiere Pro 25.1 and earlier, the Frame.io Panel in Premiere Pro can be found in the [Adobe Exchange Marketplace](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/202297) as an add-on extension. Once installed, go to the Extensions drop down under Windows and select &quot;Frame.io: Comments&quot; to open the panel. 

**Getting Started ** 

In the Frame.io panel, start by clicking **Sign In **or **Create an Account** to get into your Frame.io account. A browser tab will appear for your login credentials. 

**Export** 

Once logged in, you will see the option to Export and Share your active sequence to Frame.io. This is how you will be able to upload the latest version of your Premiere project to Frame.io for initial feedback. 

 

Click **Export &amp; Share **to begin the process. 

 

Make sure to setup the following options for exporting: 

**Name** of the video 
**Preset** for preferred video quality 
**Upload to** the location of your choice inside your Frame.io V4 account 
 

**Selecting a Location** Make sure you choose an account that is V4 ready in this version of the Frame.io panel, as Legacy (V3) accounts will not be supported. Legacy accounts will be greyed out and un-selectable from this dropdown. 

 *Note:** If you want to work inside your Legacy accounts, you can access them from any previous Frame.io panel builds.* 

When a V4 account is selected, any Workspace, Project, and Folder you have access to will be selectable as a location for the new export. 

 

 

Once you&#x27;re ready to export, click the **Export **button, or export via **Send to Media Encoder**. 

**Share ** 

When the video is uploaded, you&#x27;ll see the options to **Edit Share **and **Copy Link **at the top of your panel. 

Clicking **Copy Link** is the fastest way to grab the Share link when you&#x27;re ready to send to other Reviewers for feedback. 

Clicking **Edit Share **will send you to a new browser tab inside of Frame.io to properly set up a Share link, allowing you to take advantage of Frame.io’s advanced sharing capabilities, such as Share permissions and branding. 

**Commenting ** 

You can also begin leaving comments when the video is done uploading. Comments in Share links from your Reviewers will auto populate in real-time in the Frame.io panel. You can make your own comments or replies below the comment cards. Clicking a comment card will jump your playhead to the correlating moment in your Premiere Pro timeline. 

*Note:** At this time, annotations, anchored comments, comment attachments, and downloads are not compatible with the Frame.io panel.* **Comment Markers** 

Comment Markers will automatically appear in your Premiere timeline when toggled on, allowing you to match your comments directly to your sequence. 

 

**Auto-Version Stacking** 

Whenever you make any adjustments to sequence, the panel will detect a change and ask you to upload a new version once you&#x27;re ready. Click **New Version **for a single-button upload of your latest edit. The video will automatically version stack in Frame.io, keeping your similar edits organized and easily findable. 

**FAQ** **Q: How come I can&#x27;t access my Legacy accounts in this panel?** **A: **You can only use the new Frame.io panel in Premiere Pro to work with your V4 accounts. Legacy accounts will be visible but disabled within the V4 panel. 

**Q: Why isn&#x27;t there a media player or a way to import footage in this version of the Premiere integration?** 
​**A: **We’re working to place parts of the Frame.io user experience where users most expect it, starting with the commenting panel. Keep an eye out for more updates to Premiere Pro to see how Frame.io becomes an even more natural part of your day-to-day editing. 

**Further Support and Resources**For additional resources, refer to the user guide accessible within the Frame.io extension or contact Frame.io customer support for advanced troubleshooting and guidance. Detailed guidance on using the Comments Panel is provided in the help documentation.

 

**Q: How do I use the Frame.io panel if I&#x27;m on an older version of Premiere Pro? ****A:** The Frame.io Comments Panel for V4 is available in the [Adobe Exchange Marketplace](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/cc/202297), or is built natively into Premiere Pro (Beta) Getting the panel from Adobe Exchange will enable you to use it with previous versions of Premiere Pro down to Premiere 20.0.
