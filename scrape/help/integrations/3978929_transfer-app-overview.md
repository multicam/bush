**What is Frame.io Transfer?***[Download Frame.io Transfer here for Mac and PC](https://frame.io/transfer/)*
​
The Frame.io Transfer app is the easiest and most efficient way to upload and download bulk content, large folder structures, and entire projects, with the same speed and reliability that you have come to expect from Frame.io. Upload your files and folder structures directly from your desktop into your Frame.io projects; download the original files, or choose multiple proxies.
​
Active downloads and uploads can be monitored within the app’s transfer queue, where you can also reprioritize items with a simple drag and drop. You can also cancel in-progress transfers or clear previous completed transfers. You can even use industry-standard exchange lists like an EDL, FCPXML, or FCP7XML to download specific files used in your edit.
​
Users will be prompted to download with Frame.io Transfer when downloading two or more files, an entire folder, or a single file &gt;2GB. The Frame.io Transfer app is currently available for download on both Mac and PC and accessible to users across all account permission levels. 

## V4 SupportBeginning with Frame.io Transfer v.1.2.0 and later, Frame.io Transfer features Frame.io V4 compatibility. Easily switch between any Legacy (V3) and V4 accounts while using the Transfer app now instantly in the Transfer app. 

 

**FAQ****Q: If I have the Transfer app already installed, do the same steps apply in the web app?**
​**A: **If you already have Frame.io Transfer installed on your device, you can still initiate downloads to Frame.io Transfer from the web app. Just follow the prompts described above.
​
​**Q: Who can use Frame.io Transfer?**
​**A:** All users can use Transfer to download assets, but only Team Members and Collaborators can use Transfer to upload assets. For downloading, Team Members and Collaborators will have access to do this within the Teams/Projects they’ve been invited to. Reviewers and Presentation recipients will have access to do this within the share link they’ve been sent, as long as downloading is enabled.
​
​**Q: Do I require a Frame.io log-in credential to use Transfer?**
​**A: **No! The Transfer app can be accessed via share links by unauthenticated users. In the same way, un-authenticated users can leave feedback on Review Links. If Transfer is already installed, downloading through the Review or Presentation link (if enabled) will sync via Transfer automatically. 

**Q: Will Transfer allow me to keep multiple downloads going over a long period of time? I don’t want to restart the process with my larger files.**
​**A: **As of the 1.1.0 update, Transfer will be stable for downloads that last over 24 hours, so there should fewer interruptions for longer file transfers. In fact, the app can now process 2x as many simultaneous downloads to increase bandwidth saturation on high-speed networks for even faster delivery of those large batches from Frame.io. 

**Q: Are there any limitations with using Frame.io Transfer with a V4 account?****A: **The only noted limitations at this time are that users cannot yet start downloads in the Transfer App from V4 Web and that Forensic Watermark downloaded files are not supported in V4 at this time.
