The **Move To** and **Copy To** actions can move or copy a single file, multiple files, or an entire folder to different locations across your account for an easy organization on the web app, and it’s just as easy to organize media on the go with these actions on the Frame.io iOS App.
​**Move To**Open the menu options on a single file or folder by tapping the three dots and select **Move To**. Files can be moved within the same project or across the entire account by selecting “Current Project” or “All Projects”.
​
After selecting the project, you can move them into an existing folder or create a new one using the folder icon in the top right corner. 

 

Tap **Move Here **to confirm the move. While the move is in progress, the “Moving” button will be greyed out. 
​
Moving a single file can also be done from the player page by pressing the three-dot menu in the top right corner of the Player.
​ **Copy To**Open the menu options on a single file or folder by tapping the three dots and select **Copy To**. Files can also be copied to the same project and across the entire account using the “Current Project” and “All Projects” options. 

 

To create a new destination folder, click the folder icon in the top right corner. Tap **Copy Here **to begin the copy.
​
If you need to copy the comment with the asset, check the “Copy with comments” option on before clicking “Copy Here”. 

 

Copying a single file can also be done from the Player by pressing the three-dot menu in the top right corner of the Player.
​ **Multi-select Move To/Copy To**To select multiple assets or folders to move or copy to bulk, tap the checkmark icon in the top bar to enter into **Selection mode. **This will add a tick mark circle next to every asset and folder to select one action. After selecting your items, tap the “Move to” or “Copy to” at the bottom of the screen.
