Your first time opening the Frame.io Apple TV App, you&#x27;ll be asked to properly authenticate your Frame.io account before accessing your inbox.

 

You should see the options available to you below to either scan the QR code to automatically authenticate or to go to [activate.frame.io](http://activate.frame.io/) and enter in the given 6-digit code to manually authenticate. You will receive a unique QR or web code any time you authenticate. 

 

If authenticating via the QR code, simply scanning it with your phone camera will log into your Frame.io account to connect to Apple TV. If the login is successful, the connection will be made.

 

If authenticating without the QR code, you will be prompted to use the 6-digit code to connect to the Apple TV App. After confirming the device you want to connect to, the connection will be made.

 

 

Once the connection is made between your account and the Apple TV App, you will be able to see everything inside your profile account in Frame.io in the Apple TV App. Up to 8 additional profiles can be saved on a single device with the same authentication steps by selecting **New User** on the &quot;Who&#x27;s watching?&quot; screen.
