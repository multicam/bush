**Access Groups (Beta)** is the way to organize Members in your account into a single group for faster invites and more advanced user management. Instead of inviting multiple people to a single Workspace or Project, you can now create an Access Group to list all Members within a company under one listing and keep all your Groups organized by both Members and Permissions within the Group. 

To create an Access Group, open your Account Setting, go to the Group (Beta) tab, and click **New Group**. Create a Group title, pick an emoji, and click **Create**. *Note:** For those customers managing accounts via the Admin Console, you can also sync existing Adobe User groups to your Frame.io account. You can learn more about that **[here](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/13706126-syncing-user-groups-from-the-admin-console)**.*Now you can start adding new Members to your group. From the Group tab, you can click the “+” button under Members and select the Members you would like to add into the Group, or you can go to the **Users** tab and right-click any Member and click **Add to Group **and select the Group you want to add them to. 

 

To add an Access Group to a resource, go to an invite space like you normally would, but instead of typing their email address, type in the name of the Access Group. You will see the name of the Access Group appear along with the number of Users who are in the Group. This will automatically invite all Members of the Access Group once selected and sent. Once added, their Permissions can be adjusted if needed. 

 

 

At any time, a Member can be added to multiple Access Groups in your Workspace. If a Member needs to be removed from an Access Group, click the **Remove **button next to their name in the Group listing under the Group section in the User tab.
