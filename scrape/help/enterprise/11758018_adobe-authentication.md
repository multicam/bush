**Adobe authentication** allows for stronger 2FA security and synchronizing with your Frame.io account, as well as allowing for customers to build their own integrations and use partner integrations with Frame.io V4’s API. To learn more about utilizing the V4 API, read our developer docs [here](https://developer.adobe.com/frameio/guides/). 

*Note: **SSO and Google authentication must be disabled before setting up Adobe authentication.* 

**How to authenticate** Head to your Account Settings page and under the Profile tab, you will find the Adobe listing located under the Authentication section that reads “Connect to sign in to Frame.io with your Adobe account”. Click **Connect** to begin the authentication process. 

 

After clicking **Connect, **you will be asked to confirm that your Frame.io email and Adobe email are matching for the authentication to properly work. Click continue if the two are matching. Otherwise, update your existing Frame.io email to match your Adobe email before proceeding. 

 

Next, you will be prompted with login authentication for both of your accounts to connect to proceed. First with your Frame.io login password (which will appear within the same web page), then with your Adobe password (which will appear as a pop-up window). 

 

 

 Finally, you’ll see a prompt to switch to Adobe authentication. Confirm the connection by clicking on **Connect.** 

 

 

**FAQ** **Q: Why don’t I see the connect button in my Account Settings? ****A:** Check to see if you have SSO or Google Authentication enabled for your Account User. If both are enabled, you’ll need to disable to be presented the option to connect to Adobe. 

**Q:** **Can I use Adobe Auth if I am an SSO user?** 
​**A: **No, unfortunately not at this time. If you currently have Single Sign On (SSO) enabled, you&#x27;ll need to first disable it before connecting to your Adobe account; you can reenable SSO once connected. 

**Q: Am I able to set up Adobe Auth if I have a different email than my Frame email? ** 
​**A: **No, the two emails must be the same for authentication to properly sync. Make sure to update your Frame.io email to be the same as your Adobe email before starting the authentication process. 

**Q: If I need to, how can I disconnect the authentication?** 
​**A: **This will require help from our support team. Please reach out for further assistance.
