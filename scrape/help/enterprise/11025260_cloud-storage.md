Uploading files into Frame.io utilizes Frame’s cloud storage. This storage is distinct from cloud storage provided to Adobe Enterprise and Team customers. To learn more about Adobe cloud storage click [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/storage-limit-cce-cct.html). 
​When purchasing licenses of Frame.io via Adobe, your account will be granted pooled storage. It is important to consider that if you choose to cancel licenses, your pooled Frame.io storage will be reduced. Depending on the amount of storage you are already using in your account, this could result in your Frame.io account going over its storage quota and becoming locked. You can learn more about that [here](https://help.frame.io/en/articles/2673548-plan-limits-in-frame-io).
