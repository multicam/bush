Owners and Content Admins will have access to a **Workspaces** page in Account Settings. The Workspaces page shows all of the account’s Workspaces in one place. Owners and Admins can search Workspaces by name, sort by any column, delete and add new Workspaces to the account. They will also be able to easily glean their Workspaces’ project counts, last updated times, creation dates and storage information at a glance. *Note:** This feature is only accessible to Enterprise customers.* 

### Creating and managing a Workspace To create a new Workspace, go to the **Workspace **tab in your Account Settings and click **New Workspace**. You can still create a new Workspace from the **Home **page as well from the left panel. You&#x27;ll be given the same options to name and add an avatar for the Workspace. Click **Save** to continue. 

You will see a list of every Workspace that belongs to your account in a list view from the Workspace tab. Detailed information of each Workspace&#x27;s member count, Project count, storage count, and more can be seen. Click on any column to organize your Workspaces by that category.

 

### SearchUtilize the search bar on the top of the Workspace list to better find the Workspace you&#x27;re looking for if you&#x27;ve created a list too long to scroll through. As you actively type the name, the results will filter to the matching Workspace names.

 

### Workspace panelTo view even more detailed information on a Workspace, click on the listing to bring up the Workspace panel. Owners and Content Admin users can edit the Workspace’s name and image via the settings menu or delete the Workspace. They can also see the Projects within the Workspace, view and manage Workspace members’ access, and see the count of users with Inherited access to the Workspace.
