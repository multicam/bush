**Synced User Groups** allows you to reuse existing groups of users from your Adobe Admin Console to your linked Frame.io account. Instead of inviting multiple people to a single Workspace or Project, you can now sync an existing User Group and grant that set of users permissions.*Note:** You&#x27;ll want to first make sure ​you have user groups set up on the Admin Console first before utilizing these steps to sync inside of Frame.io. You can view how to create and manage your Admin Console user groups **[here](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/user-groups.html)**.*To create a Synced User group, open your Account Setting, go to the Group (Beta) tab, click **New Group**, and select **Add Adobe User Group**. 

 

Clicking **Add Adobe User Group** will open a new modal, allowing you to search the existing groups from your linked Adobe Admin Console. 

 

Select the User Group you wish to sync and click Add. The Synced User Group will now appear in your list of Access Groups and users who are members of that group and have a Frame.io licenses to your account will be populated. Users in the Adobe User Group who do not have a Frame.io license to your account will not be synced.

 

 

Synced User Groups:
• **Cannot** have their membership edited. To edit membership, do so from the Adobe
Admin Console.
• Synced Groups use a consistent emoji icon and cannot be edited.
• Synced User Groups can be removed from your Frame.io account. This does not remove or delete them from your Adobe Admin Console.
• Can be granted permissions to Workspaces and Projects similar to Frame Access Groups. 

Synced User Groups allow you to reuse the existing groups you may have, including those synced from other tools and systems. They offer a powerful and scalable way to manage your Frame.io permissions.
