When working as part of a large team managing many projects, it&#x27;s very easy to have your media assets quickly stock up and become difficult to manage, especially if you&#x27;re looking to find the right ones to clear out. **Asset Lifecycle Management** in Frame.io enables you to set an automated expiration time period for your newly uploaded assets to auto-delete and keep things fresh in your account. Controlled by account admins, this Enterprise feature can reduce the burden of manual asset maintenance, mitigate content security risks, and help customers control costs at scale. 

## Account SettingsInside your Account Settings, the Content Security tab is where you will find the **Default Asset Lifecycle Policy** setting. Here you can set your default auto-delete duration to **30**, **60**, or **90 days that will apply to newly created Workspaces. **You can also choose a custom period of time by clicking **Custom**. Select **None** to turn off default Asset Lifecycle on **newly created Workspaces.***Note:** As this is the default setting, this does not mean that this feature can&#x27;t be used when **None** is selected. It just means that it isn&#x27;t applied automatically when creating a new Workspace or Project. Asset Lifecycle can still be applied when **None **is selected in your Account Settings **at the Workspace level.*** 

## Workspace SettingsWhen creating a new Workspace or editing the settings of an existing one, you can adjust the **Asset Expiration** setting to auto-delete assets to the duration of your choice after the upload date. This can be different from the setting you create in your Content Security settings and will override its default setting to whatever you choose for the Workspace. Click **Save** to confirm. 

 

## Project SettingsAsset Lifecycle can also be turned off for specific Projects within Project Settings. Go to the **Project Settings** and select the toggle to either activate or deactivate the Asset Lifecycle policy that was selected on the Workspace level of that the Project is apart of. Turning off the Asset Lifecycle toggle on the Project will ignore any auto-deletion of assets in this Project. Click **Save** to confirm. 

 

## Asset SettingsWhen Asset Lifecycle is activated on an asset, you will see a clock icon in the lower left of the thumbnail of the assets will the time that is left before the asset is auto-deleted. Hover over the asset to see a pop-up *&quot;This asset will be deleted in x days.*&quot; 

 

If necessary, a Content Admin or Owner can reset and Asset&#x27;s Lifecycle clock if you want to give it more time. Open up that asset&#x27;s settings in the three-dot menu and select **Reset Lifecycle (x days) **to start the countdown over for this asset, or multiple assets with multi-select. 

 

## Asset Recovery When an asset is auto-deleted, it is moved into the trash bin of that Project space. Go to the **Recently Deleted **folder in Project space to see any of the assets that were previously deleted or auto-deleted within your Project. You can recover these assets within 30 days if necessary before they are permanently deleted from Frame.io.Related ArticlesConnect Frame.io to Adobe LightroomWhat to expect when updating to V4: A comprehensive guide for Enterprise customersWhat to expect when updating to V4: A comprehensive guide for updating your account on a Free, Pro, or Team PlanForensic WatermarkingAdobe Workfront Integration Overview
