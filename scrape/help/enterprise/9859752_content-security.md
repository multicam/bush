Within the **Content Security **page, Account Owners and Admins will be able to adjust Sharing and Watermarking Settings for their Enterprise account. *Note:** This account settings tab is only accessible to Enterprise customers.* 

 

### Share SettingsWith **Default Share Expiration, **Owners and Admins can set the default length of time that their account shares should expire. Select the period of time you would like for any share link to expire. Once it expires, it will not be accessible to anyone outside of your Workspace. 

**Require Passphrase for Public Shares** will make all share links require a passphrase to access the contents of the share link for anyone both outside of or internally within the Workspace. 

### Secure Share Settings**Enable Authorized Domain **will allow anyone with sharing permissions to choose to give access to all users from any domains you insert. Write in the domain names below this setting for who you would like to keep share access limited to. 

When creating a Share link, there should now be an option to **Include authorized domains **to toggle on or off. 

 

**Require Secure Shares **is an option to disable the creation of all public Shares. 

**Default Share Access Type **lets you choose whether you want to have your default shares be Public or Restricted. This saved setting will apply to all future shares you make once applied. 

### Watermark SettingsApply a watermark to assets for **Internal Playback &amp; Downloads** or on **Shares Playback &amp; Downloads**. The first option applies to all assets viewed within your Workspace, while the second option applies to all assets viewed in a Share. For both settings, you can set a default watermark template to appear on assets from this account. There are additional controls for watermarking in Workspace settings and on Share settings.
