We&#x27;re sorry to see you go! Frame.io would love to have you back when you start your next project. 
​
To start the cancellation process go to your Billing page under your Settings. Select **Cancel Plan** and complete the questions.
​ 

Cancellation is effective at the end of your billing period. After cancellation, your account will downgrade to free plan with reduced storage and features. [Learn more about the free plan](https://frame.io/pricing).
​
Please plan accordingly as you may need to delete files to stay within the reduced storage limits.
​
You can resubscribe to your subscription at any time prior to the end of your billing cycle via your Account Settings, or by purchasing a new plan.
​
Please contact our support team with any questions you have via the in-app chat icon.
