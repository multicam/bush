If a banner is showing at the top of your Frame.io view, you may have hit a plan limit. 

 

**Frame.io will display a notification banner when you have reached any of the following plan limits:** Payment overdue/card expired

Member limit exceeded

Guest member limit exceeded

Storage (active) limit exceeded

Storage (archival) limit exceeded

Project limit exceeded *(Free plan only)*Workspace limit exceeded

## What happens when a plan limit is exceeded? If you have hit or exceeded a plan limit, you will see a banner at the top of the page. As the banner states, we recommend removing or deleting whatever overage has occurred to resolve the issue quickly (or in the case of a billing issue, to update the card on file).

 

You can do so by opening your **Settings **and clicking on the **Usage **tab to see what overage needs to be addressed. 

Additionally, for storage and member limits, you can expand your account by upgrading your plan to a higher tier that supports more storage and members, allowing for a more comfortable workflow.

 

## Locked accountIf you find that you are currently locked out of your account, it is most likely due to that exceeded limit or unpaid bill on your account not being addressed after your allotted grace period ends. If you find access to your account temporarily blocked, reach out to our support team for assistance to help resolve the issue and once resolved, they will be able to restore and unlock your account.
