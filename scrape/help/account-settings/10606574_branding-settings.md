In your Account Settings, the Branding tab offers two ways to customize your branding inside of Frame.io.

 

## AccountGive your account a new title and logo to help your team and stakeholders identify your account. Select the text and type to make changes. Click on the picture icon then drag and drop or click to upload an image. This will be the logo and title for your account and will not replace your personal profile information.

 

## SharesSet a default template for all your Shares created in your account here, including logo, colors, and header image. You can preview how they will look in both Grid and Reel layouts in the preview display. Once applied, all new Shares will automatically default to these settings, but can be changes if needed. These defaults will apply to new Shares only and will not adjust to past Shares.
